# CS475-Machine-Learning-Final-Project
We provide you with the whole dataset and the test-validation-test splits. To run these model, all you need is the test-validation-test splits. Notice for the baseline and CNN, we use the dataset from the folder "Data without stop word".  For BERT and LSTM, we use dataset from the folder "Data with stop word". Those two folder are transformed from the same raw dataset. The only differenece is whether or not we remove the stop words.
