i lost my job a couple of month ago i noticed something in me had changed i did n't know what it wa but i wa a different person altogether i guess somewhere along the line i must have lost a sense of self worth i started entertaining dark thought i struggled getting out of bed sometimes i lost my appetite i cared le about the people around me even those genuinely trying to reach out to me where i 'm from depression ha never been considered an issue i mean i have never even had this type of conversation with my peer so i 've been holding this in doing my level best to convince myself and everyone around me everything is ok. last month i came close to losing my mum to high blood pressure i saw her in the weakest state i 've ever seen and my heart broke to piece but i had to keep face cause i 'm her only son and i had to be there just to make her feel everything is fine she still ha to undergo an operation today i flunked an interview and just lost a nephew and i really going through it i really feel suffocated and i really do n't know who to talk to or do what 's messed up is i know what i must do but mastering up the strength to do it is so hard today when i got the call from my about my nephew i started putting serious thought to it this is strange cause i have never felt like this before i 'm perpetually sad even when i think i 'm happy all it take is minute alone and i 'm sad again,1
so yeah fuck this shit boy did my life go exactly opposite of how i imagined it i do n't even know how to phrase it correctly lol i turned gay i do n't know how but it did i went from straight to gay not born i remember having my first sexual fantasy at year old about a girl in my class i remember being fascinated by breast when they were shown on movie like titanic friday the etc or even when the nudity wa implied charlie 's angel i wa so fascinated with this i remember drawing girl either nude or in sexy outfit i wa looking foward to grow up cause i really wanted to have sex i thought about holding and licking breast so much a a kid there are way more memory than just this but just to give an idea now i 'm not sure if those memory are even real for the past year i 've been reliving those memory a a way to prove myself that i 'm not gay because i really do n't want to be it 's not that i live in a hostile environment that my parent are homophobic that my friend wo n't accept me or that my faith condemns it no the exact opposite my parent are open minded my friend are too and some of them are gay and i 'm an atheist it just is n't who i want to be i do n't care about not having a traditional family i care about who i have sex with who i cuddle during a movie i would rather have everyone think i 'm gay and be straight.even if being gay wa the norm i would choose to be straight straight guy i would rather be a lesbian i just need to be with woman nowadays the fantasy about woman come and go but for the past month i have n't been able to get an erection by thinking or looking at woman and if i think about it hard enough i can get an erection about a man i keep testing myself with porn and i 've got precum by watching gay porn i 've been struggling with suicidal thought for the past year and their intensity come and go but lately man they are strong i just feel hopeless i keep rewatching the movie that remind me of my sexual awakening how much i wanted to be with a woman and cry just cry my lung out i 've decided that i will do it in a few year i 've decided where and how that idea give me some kind of peace i wish so much reincarnation wa a thing just to get the life i wished for,1

a social trend i 've noticed really like and wanted to share hello cc i 'll try to make this a quick and easy read without too much filler it all started when i wa eight jk i first noticed it last year around august when i worked a private security gig for a friend wedding all of the people there were the high end upper-crust type i remember the bride and groom and most of their friend were performer in that circus show in la vega whose name i always forget their parent were land developer all over the u and the guest were all very well off me being of a more modest lifestyle broke-ass mofo i felt pretty out of place with the crowd and for a while i foot i wa the only non-white person there i wa convinced that i wa sticking out like a sore thumb nobody there knew me it wa actually my first time meeting any of the people there other than my friend i felt like i made everyone uncomfortable by being present all the time i stood at the table of honor with my friend and even wound up in some of the family picture right i wa going for brevity anyway the entire wedding go off with only a few hitch and a we are saying our good-bye to the happy couple they thank me for helping out and then they invite me to their family-only party in perfect spanish i know i probably should n't be a shocked by that a i wa but i still found it crazy cool that they spoke spanish i do n't mean the blocky and awkward spanish from high school that you forgot immediately after graduating these kid were speaking it a if they had just moved in from guadalajara they had a small accent but other than that they spoke like a native i complimented them on their spanish and they said that they had picked it up from their nanny who would speak to them almost exclusively in spanish growing up i went to the party and wound up having a great time we would throw little jab back and forth and i found that they did n't just speak the language they had the mannerism and nuance of mexican culture down too.most of the staff wa mexican and they all got along really well typically when i meet staff of wealthy home owner staff rarely like the people they work for but this wa not the case here since i 've gotten to know more of my friend friend i have noticed the same thing with their kid who either speak spanish or some other language that they pick up from their nannies\house keepers\gardeners i also notice that people who have formed these connection with their ethnic employee tend to be much more respectful towards ethnic people or people of different tax bracket so what is the point of this super brief and concise post i feel that even with all the crap that we see in the news and online despite the general feel of having to fear everyone out there who is remotely different and regardless of those who go out of their way to spread hatred and bigotry society a a whole is moving towards a more progressive accepting and open future and i really hope i live long enough to see it,0

hey everybody i m writing this to vent about year ago my girlfriend died she died on the night of june from a car accident there wa a drunk driver swaying back and forth in the road she swerved to miss him and crashed into a tree in a ditch we met each other when we were going on year old back in 5th grade of course for a while we were just close friend but eventually it turned into more we met each other randomly i would say we just happened to be in the same class from 5th to 7th grade we hung out all the time mainly during school after 7th grade she moved a little way away and started attending another school we still hung out with each other every weekend though i would say it wa around this time we started actually dating each other fast forward to senior year of high school at this point we had been dating for some time both of u applied to the same university so that we could go together after graduating we wanted to go for film/ photography we loved each other very much we were honestly just right for each other we rarely ever argued with each other or got annoyed with each other we graduated from high school in may unfortunately right after high school she had to move about a state away for family reason but then she wa gon na be back soon for college senior year and after graduating we hung out quite a bit when she left we would txt throughout the day and talk on the phone at night on the night before june 13th we talked on the phone about random stuff for a good hour she really hated living far away from me especially right after graduating on the 13th we didn t txt each other all day because we were busy later in the day i waited until she wa free so that we could talk on the phone i txted her around but she didn t respond i just assumed she wa busy a little after i received a phone call from her mom i wa somewhat surprised she wa calling me because although sometimes she would call it just seemed odd i can not forget or even describe the pain in her voice it must ve took her a few minute to tell me what wa even going on eventually she told me that my girlfriend had died i remember initially freezing up but i could feel tear running down my face the pain anxiety and guilt wa massive that night i could not sleep at all the next night i slept maybe a few hour my life took a sharp turn when she died i wa so much more lively and joyful i just became dull and lifeless i felt lifeless a well this is kinda random but i never grew my hair out growing up it wa always buzzed short but when she died i kinda gave up and grew it out for year my life spiraled out of control for about two year i became a nihilist i lost joy in life i don t wan na go down that rabbit hole though fast forward to now i ve really came a long way since then i didn t go to college right after high school i couldn t find the motivation to after about two year i got myself together and attended college though right now in my life i m almost about to graduate from college not in film/ photography but i think she would be proud of me i wanted to write this because most people in my life have no idea that i lost someone so important losing her wa like losing half of my being lately i ve been thinking of her wishing she wa by my side a i graduate i wish she wa here it feel good to write this though for about three year i had no desire in pursuing another girlfriend but lately i ve felt the desire to do so i hope someday i find someone i can love a much a i loved her thanks for reading,1

finally committing suicide because i fucked up dear those who care i am writing this post not out of desperation but because i have no one else to inform about my fatal plan and final decision and i feel i have to write it down in order to wrap my mind around it okay my name is mads i am from denmark and currently eighteen year of age would ve turned in july i have for a long time been struggling with depression and anxiety i ve sometimes been suicidal but haven t had the gut to do it nor actually having a legitimate reason to do it i ve been on antidepressant for about month now and they haven t helped much but this isn t the reason i ve decided to end my life today thursday april 9th i fucked up bad i m too humiliated to admit what i ve done but a police report against me have been filed i do not think it wa necessary i haven t done anything technically illegal just know that but it put me in a bad light but the person filed it anyways out of revenge i informed the individual that it would destroy me and i would most likely commit suicide because of it and the person responded that he would gladly destroy my life and didn t care that i wa suicidal that wa my own issue which is true i ve been told by the same person that in eight to ten day the police will be contacting me and or my parent but i can t live with that if my parent find out they will never forgive me they might say they will but deep down i know they won t i won t be able live with that every time time they look at me this thing will be in the back of their mind nor the humiliation so i ve decided to hang myself i will be alone from saturday morning until sunday afternoon during that time i will have committed suicide i ve decided to do it with my dog s leash from the top of the stair railing i ve tried tightening the leash around my neck to see what it feel like doesn t hurt that much it s uncomfortable but i have a high pain tolerance it will definitely be successful i ve researched it a long a no one stop me it will only take a few minute until i m dead i will most likely be doing it in the middle of the night since the neighbor then won t be able to notice and stop me èdith piaf will be playing since i enjoy her music and think it will be perfect to die to these last few day i m going to make sure are perfect i want to be happy when i leave will be eating my favorite meal watch some of my favorite movie and tv show might play some video game just have a good time i m kind of looking forward to it so dear stranger now you know it wa nice to write it down and get it off my chest my time is over and i m at peace with that i ve had a nice enough life we are all going to die i ve just decided how and when,1

email ^^^^i ^^^^think ^^^^this ^^^^is ^^^^the ^^^^shortest ^^^^time ^^^^between ^^^^two ^^^^posts ^^^^i 've ^^^^had ^^^^so ^^^^far prior to the end of of the spring semester i wa always on top of all my email i hated seeing the little red number notification on my email icon on my laptop or my old ipod touch a soon a i would get an email from someone i would reply i wa always very diligent with keeping up with everything then i had to start thinking about my capstone and i had to be in contact with my capstone mentor but that still to this day when my draft is due tomorrow felt too overwhelming so i pushed it off and started checking my email le and le when i got my new ipod touch i even deleted the email app from it because i did n't want the constant reminder of my laziness when i turned on my laptop for the first three year of college i would open the email app and the internet browser a soon a my laptop turned on now i have n't opened my email app in month because i 'm afraid of the scolding email saying i should be doing this or that i still check my email in the web browser occasionally i just checked and i have unread email in my personal email and unread in my college email that 's a lot for me most of them are thing i consider spam that really are n't and only one or two are thing i should actually care about when i am done stressing about my school work and being reprimanded for not doing well i do plan on getting back into my habit of checking my email religiously like in the past i never understood how people could just let unread or even read email pile up to the thousand i had a friend with over unread email for me i read the email reply if necessary and then delete them from my inbox if they are n't important enough to keep some i 'll save into other folder or just keep in my inbox until after a specific date every now and then i 'll clear out my deleted email folder and my other folder a well when thing are no longer needed in my life i hate getting the automatic list-server email from company after buying something from them or signing up for some other service on their website i also hate getting spam after spam from organization repeatedly when i do n't even know how i got on their list to begin with i have no idea how many email list i 've unsubscribed from over the year at some point i wa getting so much spam in my inbox it took over the email i needed to get the only organization i wont unsubscribe from is the company that took my high school graduation photo they 'll still email me once every couple of month asking me to buy the photo even though i graduated in when i wa around middle school even though there wa aim facebook and texting my main way of keeping in contact with a lot of people wa via email even my grandma i still have a very small handful of those old email saved and i wish i had more just so i could look back and see what stupid shit my friend and i would share with each other that seemed so important at year old when i m working in the office i have an email relating to the theater that i keep very organized i did n't set up this email since i wa n't the first assistant my manager ha had so there are ton of email from before i started working in the office when i first started there were a large amount of unread email over and lot of useless email in the inbox i asked my manager if i could go through them and delete what wa no longer needed she showed me which type of email i should keep and what were n't necessary anymore so i went through all of them until it wa all nice and neat only a few month ago did it dawn on my to make separate folder for the old email now i have a folder for all the email before my time and folder for each six month contract since the older email are n't important unless the client return to the theater also with this email i do not check it at all unless i am in the office and getting paid my manager ha realized this and despite her workaholic personality ha accepted that i wont reply to anything when i am not in the office if something is urgent she 'll either text me and email my personal email i did n't do this so much when i first started working in the office and i felt some of the stress from work carry me home but once i took a hard stance with this approach thing got better how many unread email do you have are

hey guy i 'm new here and made this reddit specifically for this sub i have n't spoken to a single soul about how fucked up my life really is and it comforting to know people are having the exact same emotion a me and i want to know your life story if you 're comfortable i realised there wa something off about me when i wa about or and i started telling myself thing like i 'll be dead by the time i wa i wa glad to know i would n't have to live in this world and saw suicide a a comforting thought or a way out fast forward to now and i think about killing myself literally every second and it consumes my life and would tell myself weird thing like 'if the next car i see is white i should kill myself etc but never did because i do n't want to hurt my parent i live in an odd family it a very unhappy household my brother who is and life with me is in an even worse depression than i am and we do n't talk to each other we have no relationship and never have my dad ha major anger issue and my mother 's world basically ha to revolve around him and we walk on eggshell constantly my mother would never let me cry a a kid incase my dad saw me and now i do n't try to talk to her about anything she would n't let me ask him for money even though he wa on a very good salary for anything even like school book and i wa so ashamed that my teacher bought me my own when i wa about a man tried to abduct me and i wa too uncomfortable to tell my parent or anyone and kind of let it fester high school wa absolute fucking torture for me i begged and begged to leave and wa never allowed i went to a catholic girl only private school i wa bullied and always the target for nasty prank and rumour all girl school are absolute fucking hell and are just a bitchy a you would imagine when i graduated i did n't go to my formal and see high school and wa about 40kgs for a somewhat tall girl i left school got a shit paying part time job and wa studying and had to leave both to work full time because at the same time my dad not only unfairly dismissed from his government job and had to go to court to fight for it it we also got sued for because someone claimed to slip on our front yard which he never did he just wanted my dad money and eventually ended up with nothing thank god dealing with both of these thing at once changed me and my family the stress and the possibility of losing our house wa too much and i worried about coming home and seeing my dad had killed himself this whole ordeal lasted year i wa also dealing with severe chronic pain i have a jaw problem and have daily constant migraine and jaw dislocation it made my depression unbearable and i could n't get out of bed without popping pill because eating talking yawning etc would hurt too much i got another job bought a car on finance and wa offered another waitressing job i took that job and wa fired only month later for supposedly 'not smiling enough and because a customer had looked up my skirt when he saw me outside of my work and made a joke out of it to everyone when he came in next getting fired absolutely destroyed any last bit of motivation i had left in me and i would rather not work than to be treated like that ever again straight after i lost my job i got extremely ill. i am waiting to get a spot in for an mri and other test but it is believed to possible be something like a brain tumour or multiple sclerosis i can not work even if i wanted to because my symptom are too much i got back into studying a well and had to leave my course because cognitively i have been affected so badly and there no point trying to do a medical course i actually hope that it is something life threatening so i can die without my parent living knowing i killed myself and blaming themselves my life ha been a non stop fucking turn of bad luck and every sign point to 'kill yourself i feel like i am not meant to be here i will have no more medical bill wo n't have to worry about the debt of my car and do n't have to exist in such a numb state i ca n't think of a single thing that worked out well for me and i hate the world i have no friend because i will never hear from them if i do n't make the effort same go for extended family who never contact me my own counsellor voluntarily stopped my appointment without an explanation life is just so fucking pointless i never asked to be here and am expected to work shitty paying job where i get treated like shit and still not be able to afford a decent life whats the point living to pay bill i am just living to please everyone else and not upset them even though all i do is feel completely numb and stay in my room all day and go to drs appointment dying sound so peaceful my brain is endlessly playing negative thought and i am aware i will never make anything of myself i hate myself and how negative i am but also feel like nothing positive ha ever happened to me everywhere i have gone in my life i feel a though i am hated or unwanted im rejected from everything i have tried to do and would rather stay in my room all day than deal with people,1
what do you love about yourself i guess i 'll go first since there 's no one to object i like how opinionated and straightforward/brutal i am i should be apologetic over how many people i have offended and maybe exercise some self pity for the friend i 've lost and i 'm certain it will continue to bite me in the future but in this moment i want to appreciate that conscience-lacking quality make it fun guy it doe n't have to be the thing you love the most so maybe ooze out some vanity or just something you would n't otherwise admit though i would admit mine anytime,0

loneliness and frustration im in a situation right now where im seeing a girl who is not quite ready for a relaitonship and want to see how it go before we do anything a she ha just recently left one partly my fault shes kind of my escape for everything getting hectic right now and im not entirely attached but im worried if our relaitonship doesnt evolve im just gon na be back to constant self hate and not feeling confident enough to have a relaitonship most of my worry come from what feel like most people having a lack of care or interest in me i just feel like someone who doesnt really exist,1
i 've become afraid of the suburban lifestyle hey guy just wanted to see if anyone else felt this way or if anyone ha suggestion for how to stop feeling this way i grew up in a family who valued material success over pretty much anything else in high school and college i gravitated towards people who had the opposite mindset most of my friend and my fiance think of consumerism and material item a unnecessary at best and borderline evil at worst they see no point in having nice thing and are the kind who would be incredibly content living in a van in the middle of the wood or in an apartment with no furniture other than a mattress and a computer i love the fact that my friend do n't think material item are the purpose of life or the route to happiness a i think a lot of people chase that only to find at year old that it did n't create the happiness they wanted so badly but i have begun to internalize their worldviews in an unhealthy way just like how in christianity i found myself ashamed of sex and scared of intimacy because of how many time people talked of how bad it could be with my friend i have started to become terrified of a suburban lifestyle where i have material thing because of how it ca n't bring happiness and is ultimately meaningless the reason this is an issue is that part of me doe want to live a more suburban lifestyle i enjoy luxurious thing and think a long a i 'm living within my mean that 's perfectly reasonable i want to be able to go to the mall to buy a new outfit or to the store to find nice furniture for my house without being plagued by a sense of guilt or embarrassment i want to be able to create my dream nursery for my future child without feeling shallow and like i 've become some kind of robot or cog in the machine i 'm afraid that if i start doing these thing i 'll suddenly find myself very unhappy and bored or something it 's a strange flip from what i felt growing up thanks for reading looking forward to an interesting chat about this,0

every single goddamn thing wrong in my life this is a very long jumble of text i just feel like my whole life thing have just built on top of each other i do n't even think a single therapist ha heard all of the shit i think about i feel like everything in my life haunt me and nobody take it seriously because i need to hit rock bottom first i do n't seem like i need help because i have gotten okay at covering it up but people around me know i feel this way it just seems like i am not broken enough for help but i am i grew up in a family of four my parent are immigrant i have an older brother he ha severe autism and i think my dad expects me to take care of him after they are gone i can barely take care of myself and i want to move out of the area which i could not with my brother i do n't know how i would hold down a job yet pay someone to take care of him and take care of myself it mean the rest of my life would be dedicated to my brother not me i could n't get married i am already scared to have kid in case they are autistic the cultural gap in my family is hard my mom struggling with bipolar disorder anxiety and depression while insisting on no treatment meant hell for my childhood year old me spilling a glass of milk meant i got screamed at for the rest of the day banshee screaming about how i am a waste of space stupid worthless etc this go on for hour in stage if you say anything it start again my mom ha threatened my dad with a knife she refuse to take any medication in one of her episode she took me and my autistic brother to a homeless shelter because she wa convinced my dad wa evil my dad said he went after her a soon a he could but i think part of him wanted to just leave u there i always prayed for the day my parent would get divorced they were toxic for each other my dad ha severe anger issue it just worsened throughout the course of my life one time he went to visit his family in india i wa seven and my mom wa getting incredibly upset she broke off a drawer in the kitchen and threatened to hit me with it nudging it on my shoulder i called cry the police officer came my mom acted somewhat normal but said i wa misbehaving the drawer wa on the ground broken off they said it wa my fault because i misbehaved they asked if my severely autistic brother wa okay and in that decision i made a choice because i heard what happens to people like my brother in the system and my parent had money she did n't hurt my brother but i realized that what my brother could potentially go through much worse in the governmental system they asked if i had anywhere else to stay i said no they told me to go upstairs and lock myself there and gave me their number in case she did it again i called my dad all he said wa did it work can we try that next time she is upset never asked if i wa okay i spent that weekend in fear just glare snotty whisper etc whenever i received le than an a my mom would ignore me after two day she would start screaming that would be a sigh of relief because it meant she would love me again by the end of the week if she did n't i wa more worried there were weekly argument in my house between my parent they would tell me to go upstairs and ignore them but i would foolishly ask them to stop they did not care they only cared about screaming at each other my dad hate my mom but still care about her she had an abusive childhood and the alternative to her staying in our life would be to be in a mental institution with stigma because she would be a divorced woman according to indian society even though we live in america my brother 's autism mean he ca n't say i love you he would n't even know if i died he ha so many violent tantrum he just hit himself repeatedly he scream like a toddler except he 's much much older there have been so many night in my life where i did n't sleep all my grandparent passed away by the time i wa and a family friend those loss hit me hard i 've had anxiety for most of my life i rarely socialized with people because my parent did not have time with me because of my brother i wa a freak i got depression in 10th grade my perfect record a a student wa gone after that and i lost all motivation my family in india think of my family a a black sheep so they all dislike me because i suffer from mental illness along with our family they judge u but they have n't had to deal with mental illness i mean who are they to judge we went to india to see them me and my father and my uncle drunkenly said no one wanted you guy here but i convinced them to let you come i 've never felt so embarrassed in my life we still had another week we were with them my friend got raped when she wa in college i think she might hate me secretly she had a girl she knew come over and they both got drunk the other girl started puking and my friend started panicking i told her to call two people she knew there they did n't pick up and she said she wa going to ask her neighbor across the hall for help i did n't think twice and i said sure if you know him and you think he will help she started calling me the next morning but i wa tired of talking to her while she wa drunk she told me the next morning that she wa raped by him i 've felt like scum ever since because i should have told her not to go and my father had open heart surgery my senior year of high school just when i thought thing

about it i told another at college but she said i am resistant to change and in that moment she wa my last hope i almost bought charcoal to kill myself but instead i cried the whole day and missed my

becoming the writer of your story rather than a character it 's time like these where i feel a bit overwhelmed by everything kinda hitting me all at once whether it 's school work or life in general i almost physically feel pulled down by the weight on my shoulder and although there are thing i could do to lighten this weight i decided to do the opposite and take on more responsibility thing that push me out of my comfort zone and arguably stress me out but should also help me grow it wa after one certain event although minor and pretty irrelevant that pushed me to basically throw caution to the wind and say screw it i 'm tired of being comfortable all the time and losing out on experience that i know will be beneficial for example volunteering at a local elementary school or attending a networking event alone a a first year student granted i 've done these thing before but the feeling of being uncomfortable wa n't something i enjoyed i mean yeah duh obviously right who want to be uncomfortable haha but it 's made me realize that i 'm really the biggest detractor when it come to promoting my own growth so instead of being that person who is scared nervous or unsure i want to be the person that really show myself the way almost like looking into the mirror and telling myself that that person is n't me but it 's my job to make this person the best human being they can possibly be it 's not me who 's uncomfortable anymore but rather it 's the person i 'm guiding i just have to give them encouragement and i could keep trucking along but one thing to realize is that the decision you make and/or do n't make have a direct effect on the development of this character in your story and if you really want to have an amazing character you can not stay the same and comfortable through it all what are your thought another way i thought about it wa like an rpg haha this life of ours is a character that we want to become great and powerful but to get to that point we have to go through the trial and tribulation you can try but solely killing level monster or completing beginner quest will only take you so far,0

slipping back into suicidal thought i 'm not entirely sold on the idea yet i would have to see just how bad my life is going to get first but here 's my story growing up i did n't have too much to live for i had a good family at home and grew up in a middle class environment but that 's where the good fortune kinda ended not to belittle how great those are because had i not had those aspect of my life growing up i probably would be committed or dead right now but the rest of the story go like this i got bullied a lot until high school i wa fat eccentric a bit effeminate and a minority in a whitewashed town it started off with targeting me and making me look like a fool and i tried to kill myself when i wa because of it it got worse over time i 've been called everything from the n-word to insult commonly used against hispanic and indian i 'm both told to go back to my home country and beat up because of my appearance i wa molested when i wa by a school bully who pulled my pant down so that my dick wa hanging out and then the following day proceeded to grope me it made me really angry and sad and i wa scared to masturbate until i wa during and around this time i started to become really inward and cold towards people including my family who i wa very hostile and distant towards until i wa shortly thereafter i began to figure out how to fit in with the kid that were making my life a living hell i realized certain aspect of myself had to be pushed away and certain behavior had to be toned down or hidden interest a well and i could n't risk tainting my image by dating a girl who wa n't considered to be acceptable by my peer 's standard otherwise i 'd be bullied again but the girl that were everyone 's desire were n't attracted to me because i wa n't really high up there on the totem pole either look wise or popularity wise that did n't bother me but what did bother me wa that if i simply did n't want to get picked on i had to literally live a life that did not allow me to be fundamentally human i could n't express myself at all i had to monitor who i kept in my circle strictly and dating wa pretty much off the table a a teenager that wa very destructive for me i also tried to and many minority can relate to this 'whiten up i tried 'acting white identifying a white i 'm mixed race and while i wa never racist i wa very resentful of my ethnic background which made me somewhat angry at my mother who wa the reason i wa a poc i had nobody to vent to about these frustration a i felt too distant from my parent too distrusting of my peer and my closest friend were dealing with far worse issue that i did n't want to burden them with so i took them out online being a 'troll a it were i made a fake persona that wa a loose portrayal of my real life and my biggest pretty much my only target wa woman or myself in my real life i wa respectful timid and pretty self-effacing around woman be it family friend or girl i wa attracted to but when i would talk with friend and moreover when i would talk online i would absolutely shit on woman every slur you could think of mocking them objectifying them et al i did this for three reason the guy i wanted to fit in with who were either bullying me or were friend with bully almost always behaved this way only one guy i know wa n't like this that wa in that group he wa a good dude besides being a minority having 'feminine interest writing art fashion music got me bullied a lot too i wa also shamed for having crush to the point where i could n't even admit to myself that i wa attracted to girl it made me hateful of anything feminine and considering femininity wa initially conceived a a way to stereotype womanhood i hated woman for being feminine i saw them a my adversary because what society had attributed to them i thought wa inherent of them and i knew that it made me get bullied i could n't stand them because of that after being molested i wa super insecure and withdrawn about my sexuality i did n't masturbate i did n't date i only really had any remote romantic involvement with one girl in high school and that wa just conversational and a meetup once i hated the fact that i felt sexual attraction to girl because it made me feel helpless and vulnerable like the time when i got molested so i wa resentful of those feeling and lashed out in private about woman icing on the cake wa that i did n't really know what feminism wa so i assumed ignorantly that it wa just woman blindly hating men so i would wreak havoc online with insulting woman never directed at a particular woman sent to a woman or about a woman but just blind insult to woman in general i would piss people off and i ended up going completely fucking insane with this persona it became like a mr. hyde for me by day i wa mild mannered quiet and genuinely decent to people but all of my insecurity and anger were released into this ugly capsule i also tried killing myself when i wa and the only reason i survived wa because i did n't cut myself deep enough i bled out for minute profusely i soaked through an entire roll of toilet paper a gym bag i had and a few towel it wa absolutely terrifying i wa getting really bad dry mouth towards the end and i felt like i wa going to pas out had i not stopped bleeding then i would have probably needed to go to the hospital my parent who had been throwing me in and out of therapy assuming i had something wrong even though i kept it hidden by being hateful and withdrawn towards them never found this out i vehemently denied it saying my cat scratched me and eventually they gave up trying to figure it out i knew that if they found out what i did i 'd be doped up on med and potentially put away in a mental hospital i knew i had no chemical imbalance my surroundings were just driving me insane i had derealization syndrome i wa having a hard time sleeping and panic attack were regular occurrence i wa snapping but i knew it wa n't a chemical problem if they started doping me up and locking me away like i wa insane then i would turn insane and i 'd be a victim of my circumstance completely and then i went to college a i wa graduating high school i made a point of losing weight i did n't care about my look i did n't care about what people said about me and even when i wa in high school and relatively popular people chimed in about my minority status and weight a lot i just wanted to get fit i wa ridiculously out of shape and although i wa strong due to working out you would n't know it because i wa a slob i lost a lot of weight and put a lot of muscle on around the last month of school wa when i had mostly evened out i lost a little more weight over the summer and i moved into college in high school i did n't really pay attention to girl i wa very on edge about being at all vulnerable so i wa voluntarily withdrawn from dating even when i wa fat though a good amount of girl had found me attractive mostly creepy one who stalked me or obsessed over me but at least it wa something when i got to college i had come to term with that i wa n't a good looking guy i wa just not what woman wanted both a a person and with my look i wa content with this accepting of it and found comfort in it i set my expectation realistically and kept to myself but apparently i found out i wa actually pretty hot once i got in shape girl who i never even fathomed would ever find me attractive were losing their mind over me dozen of them i wa told i should go into porn once and i did a modeling shoot with a friend it wa kind of surreal it also led to me getting sexually assaulted and meeting a lot of girl who although attracted to me treated me like crap i withdrew inward but my bitterness towards woman wa declining i had become more accepted for who i wa at college and the progressive nature towards gender dynamic that college can foster made me more comfortable to be myself i wa still really down on myself because of my personality however the nail in the coffin for my misogyny and the beginning of me losing my self-hatred wa when i took this random class by an exceptional professor that ended up being about racism and sexism prior to this class i had despite racist insult convinced myself i wa white i wa still pretty iffy about feminism but i had greatly toned down the outright hatefulness i used to express online and even sympathized with a good bit of modern feminism but when i took this class and saw the fact presented to me about these thing i realized i wa never white at all despite being a light-skinned person and that feminism not only benefited woman but it really benefit men especially for a guy like me who wa n't really a stereotypical male feminism stood up for guy like me to express themselves a well a demanding equity for woman i completely dropped being sexist after that whether online in real life or in jest it wa a learning process to unlearn that stuff but i got there and slowly but surely i ended up becoming more comfortable caring accepting and even loving of myself appreciative of who i wa honestly it wa incredible how much getting in shape actually interacting with woman and learning about woman 's issue changed my perception of thing i realized just how disgusting sexism wa and how even a a joke it wa really shitty to behave in a sexist way i would n't say i 'm a feminist only because i think i may have waived the ability to be one in the day of my youth but i absolutely agree with their sentiment fast forward to my senior year i 'm about to wrap it up based off of what i previously wrote you 'd think i had a good directional change for my life path and wa ready to start life anew well that did n't happen i chose a major that i wa best suited for which wa communication specifically advertising i did well in college i have internship experience wa involved at school et cetera but i realized that the field i 'm qualified to work in via this degree raise major ethical concern for me particularly regarding privacy these were concern i wa also unaware of until it wa too late into the major track for me to switch unless i wanted to stay an extra year which i do not have the economic mean for the corporate environment for advertising is known for it sexism and racism which i refuse to tolerate at my workspace but i also will have to be tethered to social medium and be involved with big data collection ever since i wa in high school i wa up to date with the hideous thing the american government and other world government do to enforce digital surveillance without or knowledge i am vehemently against it and given recent leak about social medium surveillance stuff i 've learned in my advertising class about it and the most recent cambridge analytica scandal on facebook i 've withdrawn from social medium completely i have n't been removed from social medium in eight year now i 'm completely off i also refuse to engage in practice or be a part of a direct process of obtaining deciphering or using big data to construct essentially artificial digital world for people via rigged advertising and selective search couple this with demanding erratic hour and potentially having to be international at random time at a moment 's notice and the corporate level of what i 'm qualified to work in doe not look like the job for me problem is the nonprofit sector of what i 'm studying pay so little i would be better off working a full-time retail position at or around minimum wage elsewhere in comm i either lack the qualification to go into it broadcasting it is relatively a corrupt public relation or the corporate environment and pay is even worse journalism so at the moment and in the foreseeable future i 'm fucked i 'm applying to job in new york city where i attend school and could probably shack up with a friend splitting rent and utility obviously if i can get a solid blue collar job but if i do n't find that and that 's definitely not a guarantee i will have to move back home networking and job opportunity are scarce a it is in an outdated little town and again the racist bullshit is everywhere and the sexism quite frankly when i 'm there for too long it trigger old feeling of sadness and self-hate it 's not healthy for me to be back there and if i 'm stuck in that town i may end up being there forever i 'm also single and the loneliness is getting to me i 've got a decidedly small circle at school and we 're all very busy right now a senior so i 'm alone a lot it 's hard to fall asleep sometimes because of it i do n't like most of the woman where i grew up and i have little desire to try dating where i 'm from i do n't date white woman a a personal choice of preservation for my ethnic root so it 's very hard to find poc woman where i 'm from let alone one who i am compatible with there 's little in the way of socializing and most of the people where i 'm from are considerably older than me having no job or a part time job that i could have gotten in high school in a hometown that end up being taxing on my mental health to live in all alone and with no change in sight will definitely not yield positive result for me the linchpin for the suicidal desire come in the form of pursuing a passion of mine since i wa i rapped i did it to escape my everyday problem i quit it upon attempting to kill myself for the last time in high school and stopped rapping for five year a my life ha been spinning out of control recently due to my impending graduation and bleak outlook i 've gotten back into rapping and taught myself how to produce turn out the stuff is coming out pretty damn good a few very small time blogger have checked it out who do n't know me personally and regularly shit on people who show them music so they 're not sycophant and my friend and family and on all front i get notably positive reception there 's even it 's incredibly small but it 's existent anticipation for a project i 'm going to put out all well and good but the problem is my digital past the insensitive shit i used to say a a kid online i also aired out some family grievance online with le than ideal language and although i 've taken measure to delete the stuff nothing disappears from the internet and it will eventually come to light i also used to say i wa white on occasion online before i really understood my mixed race identity i never said anything racist online but i would also look ridiculous talking about racism from a firsthand experience if i claimed i wa white even though i 'm not white my music is about political theme such a this and people will shit on me and think i 'm a walking contradiction once this stuff is exposed i 'll be bounced out of hip-hop and then i wo n't be employable and my family will think le of me so i 'll spin out of control my entire life will be marred by the thing i said in a time of deep hurt ignorance and nihilistic rage a a teenager because although i may grow and change that past is permanent via the internet my one shot to potentially live out a childhood dream and escaping my current situation ha effectively been killed even if the music never blew up enough for me to make a full-time living off of it if it blew up at all and people connected the dot i 'd be exposed and the damage would be done my ethic and fear of technocracy have led me away from pursuing a job with my major i 'm left with essentially nothing to live for and wa thrown into this situation partly of my doing but absolutely a a reaction to my circumstance i feel completely hopeless and that all of my personal initiative to better myself and change my life were pointless i feel that if i just killed myself year ago the disappointment that will be my adult life and the suffocation of most likely spending the rest of my day in my hometown that hate people like me would have been avoided a well a the loneliness if it get a bad a i think it is going to get upon graduation by this time next year i will not be alive,1
will this wish ever go away will i ever be normal,1

i d say that everyone should at least try to go on a restricted diet for at least month it s really helpful for cleansing and is also very eye opening one other thing that i noticed is that a long a you try to eat healthier that your overall mood and persona change to happier and more energetic now i don t suggest that you become a vegan bc of animal right or some b like that but going carb free or just making better choice is something that everyone should do,0

drug and depression don t mix all i ever heard from my friend wa that you can t get addicted to weed if you believe this that s fine but if you find that you relate to a lot of post in this sub i hope you listen i found that when i smoked i wa able to escape my anxiety and depression for the night it wa really nice and i started doing it every weekend then my work would pile up or i d have a fight with a friend and i d smoke on a weeknight i ll be honest with you it worked for a while i started to enjoy life more and i started to get really interested in mountain climbing i kept this up and i became more social thing were going well and i just kept smoking eventually i went on spring break and didn t smoke the entire time because i couldn t bring anything on the plane this is where thing started to go downhill over the break i had multiple mental breakdown the like of which i had never experienced at my lowest i remember cry in my car so hard that i wa literally screaming unintelligibly thought filled my head of driving my truck off a bridge i hadn t thought like this in a while though i have always battled depression when i got back from break i smoked immediately and i felt better to make sure i had fixed myself i smoked the next day and the next day and the day after that before i knew it i wa getting high three time a day not only did my use increase the effect began to change whenever i smoked i felt like i wa a total failure that had nothing going for me it wa like my intrusive thought of self loathing had finally figured out how to get into my high mind and they didn t leave very easily i had terrifying dream sometimes too i had a recurring one of me falling off of a mountain which really killed my newfound enthusiasm for climbing i went on a trip with my friend to a different part of my state today he s in the military so i didn t bring any of my smoking stuff because i wa gon na be around him and other military member that can t smoke anyways they get drug tested the anxiety attack came a scheduled it felt like something terrible wa going to happen but i didn t know what i wa shaking and i couldn t stop fidgeting i wa able to hold it together on the outside but i lost control of my emotion i texted my best friend a few state away and said some terrible thing to her still i don t even understand it she told me that she had been smoking and it s like a switch wa flipped in my brain it wa like i hated her immediately i told her she wa a bad friend and i wa sick of talking to her i still don t understand it i don t feel that way and i don t know why i did what i did luckily she s a strong person and thing will be fine between u but i legitimately thought about killing myself over this not going to lie writing it down really help though i don t feel like the same person anymore smoking doesn t give me the relief that it used to and whenever i stop i get worse than i ever wa before i started this stupid habit i m not going to demonize people that like to smoke i know a lot of folk can handle it better than me but please don t make the same mistake i did substance won t cure you they will just make your mental illness go away for a little while and come back with a vengeance having tried some other drug i m making a decision now to cut all of it out of my life before i become dependent on something that will really screw up my health i know that my problem are pretty small compared to some on this sub but if sharing my experience help one person steer clear of this path then i will be glad i took the time to write this i hope you all find yourselves,1

it a strange feeling to be stuck every day feel the same but every day you feel le your psyche ha stretched over too thinly you lose the goal you once believed in you eat too much indulge in your basest desire forget that you used to exist really exist people tell you just change it up exercise make some money so you get the job get the girl the clothes or the body you wanted but it doe n't change or it doe n't feel like it ha still in the blackest part of your brain is the voice the feeling like your tissue is contorting itself bracing for the world to end this will come crashing down it tell you day in day out and when the day are the same it tends to be the thing you start to remember and all a sudden four year have passed you need a fresh start a brand new perspective but you ca n't seem to find one you try to fix this unfamiliar land you 've woken up in but it hard a remembering the path you 've taken the people you did n't mean to hurt you do n't know why but now it seems worse you can feel it again the lens ha cleared if only briefly and you do n't know where to begin you have a choice exercise make some money believe in thing again try if you don t all that remains is the abyss an endless freefall in a darkened snow globe where none of your choice are choice at all nothing could ever be so disastrous you have a choice,1

i 'm going to commit suicide tommorow there 's nothing stopping me if you call the cop i will just go when i get out of the psyche ward the reason why i 'm commiting suicide really is n't selfish or anything i 'm just in a lot of pain i wa hit by a car yr ago and havent been the same since my head always hurt like a lot it so bad there no relief in sight i really do n't know what ha prevented me from commiting suicide till now i wanted to before but wa too scared but now i have nothing to lose no family no friend no opportunity to ger better i 've tried it all and med only make thing worse the time i 'm not in pain my head just feel empty it unbearable and ali cant function i just lay around all day like a vegetable pushing through the pain i sometimes have bad panic attack or bad pain throughout the body i think it a type of fibromyalgia i cant even watcha movie in piece i always feel rushed and even this message i do n't even know what ai wrote i just have a short attention span i most likely have some sort of brain damage if it any comfort i 'm dying from hep c ina year anyways so i 'm saving me the pain i 'm just writing it here because i know my parent will send me to a psyche ward where ill be put on med that make the pain worse if you do call the cop ill definately do it ill probably be a pusyy and si out since i fear the pill will just add to the damage and inwont die like i do n't even want to die i love life and being with people and my parent and friends.what i ca n't support is the constant pain and the leech to society i 've become there 's no hope for me like seriously i 've tried it all i can keep on living but it jo lofe to live,1

dropped out of grad school last september applied a '3rd year transfer accepted student start from 3rd yr of college to nursing school school year start around the beginning of an year where i live so i juuust got a bunch of rejection and i am kinda dazed i actually have yr of nursing education from my first undergrad school which should have been a huge plus when i applied but i fucked up interview and my undergrad gpa is complete shit so i read about other grad school dropout and them saying it 's not the end of the world i do feel actually relieved that i quit relatively early i lasted a bit le than yr but here is the thing those other dropout had a lab tech part time job to go back to and they had 'normal social skill such thing a 'lab tech do n't exist where i live and even if there is it is all occupied by student with connection or from the best science institute in this country where all the genius go to think mit i would n't even get to the interview stage because gpa is shit i did do some research while i wa in grad school although they are not a complete a the 'real one i have portfolio containing plan of couple project i came up with experiment analysis and -done review paper that should have been my master 's thesis i actually got to the interview stage for one of my nursing school application which is probably because they allowed sending extra porfolio of anything the applicant have done during college year even tho my gpa wa shit but i probably screwed up the interview and a couple weird question i had to answer orally i only had minute and i panicked so i loyally screwed them up aaand i have a severe crippling social anxiety and overall anxiety i think because i can not be in a 'neutral state or relax if im not on xanax without my med i am constantly alert tense which lead to me being irritable and prone to a fit of rage i read about people 's parent being happy that they can spend more time with their sth child after they come back after quitting grad school but both my parent have some kind of stigma or hatred of adult kid living with them mother is not so severe about that but my father is crazy and provokes me when i did nothing wrong and just peacefully walk across the living room he threatens me with my weakest point which he found out after i started going to a psychiatrist sth happened a few day ago that completely severed any kind of respect i had for father and i may sound like a piece of shit here but i could not care le if he just up and died right now if only he wa n't the only source of income in my family there is a reason for this even when i try so hard to be a 'good adult kid doing chore and stuff he actually try to make me into this dipshit adult kid who leech off parent he actually try so hard to make me the villain and that make me mad and if i show any anger about it he go apeshit and all hell break loose so couple day ago i finally thought 'fine you want me to be a shitbag leech then i 'll be that for you i am sick of feeling guilty being forced to being 'the problem kid in the family i wo n't show this explicitly while i live in my parent place but once i get settled i plan to sever all connection with father just seeing him make me tense and angry now so i started resorting to xanax so yeah all school rejected me the rigid fucked up school system here wo n't allow until the next year school here do n't even allow credit from previous school to be transferred even if it is literally the same subject of the same major so if i take the fucking univ entrance exam again it will be another year of bullshittery the school are corrupted here the student councel especially but the school say nothing about it i am so sick of seeing those thing i think about going to a nursing school in canada u would be familar to me since i spent some of my childhood there but school are really expensive there if i go abroad i do n't need to go to some big univ i just want a nursing program that let me become an rn and let me work in a big university hospital or other big private one i am definite about what i want for my job environment not a total desk job not a total manual labor either requires me to think so i do n't get bored or feel useless corporate environment feel too hostile for me so i want to work in a big hospital and since i 'm not smart enough to be a doctor i 'd be happy with becoming an rn i briefly looked up a couple canadian school but they still are expensive idk if i could transfer some of my credit i know i should be looking into all this right now but i am so let down by all the rejection i got literally yesterday and mentally exhausted from a somewhat hostile family situation it 's to the point i eat by myself in my room because literally every singlentime i sit with family father brings sth up and blow me up.and all go to shit and i lose my shit and everyone hate me and i become a po kid leech i am sick and tired of that shit so i avoid that altogether and severe soical anxiety mean no friend lmao i literally know no one outside of my family i hardly talk at all i have to really keep track of my med or i become really nervous or depressed now im too tired to type i love gaming but all tho rejection took away the joy along with any appetite im just lying in bed no music just darkness and a blanket over my head thinking nothing feeling nothing im gon na try to play some video game i recently found out that gaming really ups my mood and i actually use my brain for sth even if it just figuring out how to stealth rob this bigass bank haha,1
waiting for admission decision just to find out about incomplete application about six month ago i completed a few application to phd program i wa interested in my job environment wa toxic so i decided to quit and move home just waiting to hear back from these school in the meantime i ve been working a part time job and put my life on hold i wa admitted to my back up school in december but almost immediately eliminated it from contention i wa really waiting to hear from my first choice it is a prestigious program with only a admission rate but i wa hopeful the website said that i would hear back by at the latest so i followed up today after not receiving any information when i spoke to the admission counselor they told me that one of my reference letter wa never received my application wa not even viewed let alone considered at this point the program ha filled all of their spot and there is absolutely nothing i can do except reapply next year i realize a an adult it s my responsibility to follow-up and verify but i still feel robbed i never saw an indicator that my application wa not complete and it wa labeled a submitted i would ve much rather been rejected based on merit than this situation ha anyone ever been in a similar situation how did you cope,0

my hubris laziness and envy cost me everything february 17th wa the best day of my life and one i wo n't forget at eighteen year old i can count the amount of notable life experience i 've had on the hand of a knife juggler with cerebral palsy besides two brief trip to chicago and d.c. i spent most of my life a a recluse i only ever went to a single friend 's house across the street when i wa very young before he moved away my parent my dad and my brother when he wa younger especially were very candid in babying me and treating me a borderline mentally disabled because i wa clumsy and had a severe speech impediment they neglected to teach me thing and admonished me when i could n't do them i live in fucking florida and i do n't know how to swim or ride a bike i have no notable memory of childhood one incident that come to mind wa one of my reading class in elementary school everyone gleefully went off to describe their fun time except for me my secluded development meant i had no real story to tell so instead i relayed a tale of me heroically winning a victory against tank in the demo of a old game called r.u.s.e i wa funny and charismatic enough either my speech impediment wa n't a pronounced back then or kid and teacher in elementary school really did n't give that much of a damn if a kid talked funny that nobody really noticed that i wa the only one with a essentially fictional story another time i made a mistake and colored outside the line with a washable marker five year old op shrugged and since it said 'washable went to the class sink put it on full blast and then cried when it tore a hole straight through the paper this story doe n't have much relevance but i just remembered it a i wa typing the last part and thought it would be funny to share while i do n't view myself a unattractive i had a very difficult time integrating socially due to my stammer and stutter many joke were left unsaid and i embraced video game roleplays and other virtual distraction a escapism i frequently procrastinated at school my grade dropped severely a i made the transition from elementary school to middle school and my schedule wa often school home video game repeat ad infinitium i became self loathing early on especially a i began to view myself a becoming 'behind in life compared to others the only thing i wa good at wa writing my junior year wa especially rough and i wa sorely tempted to commit suicide had my chronically sick father not pawned off his gun then i met her let 's call her mandy i met mandy on a roleplaying site there wa an age gap an difference in lifestyle but we hit it off quickly she said she could n't tell i had a speech impediment and so we spent a lot of time talking she had lover fwbs to which i gritted my teeth and bore it after all i wa lucky to have such a wonderful person a my friend i would n't dare ask for more but there wa something lady and gentleman of the jury doe true love exist i do n't fucking know i 'm just a depressed kid on the internet but this depressed internet kid with virtually no significant event in his life could talk to mandy on call for seven hour at a time practically continuously we literally once talked from sunset to sunrise until we both fell asleep we occasionally said the same thing a each other at the same time in our roleplay chat and i even once casually predicted the exact time she would wake up to the very minute i wa slightly smitten i felt a little more confident my english teacher who i share a strong bond with ran the school team for a county contest analogous to jeopardy i had never went to a single extracurricular activity before hand but i decided to participate to her delight it wa being held at a local college on february 17th my literature and history skill finally came in handy for something other than internet debate and our school team went from the lowest scoring team to the top of the bracket a real underdog story we went out to get ice cream afterwards my teacher and i talked and i tormented her with my satirical conservative proclamation i once called her vegan beef 'cnn meat since they were both fake which never failed to elicit laughter from her i had a good time mandy texted me though we 've been prodding at feeling for each other for awhile it culminated in mutual declaration of love she told me despite the reservation of her hungover brain how she fell more and more in love with me the more we talked it wa a sensation of utter bliss how she did n't care about the age gap anymore if it sound like bullshit then i do n't blame you i could hardly believe it myself it wa everything a love-struck little nerd like myself could dream of and more i went out to eat with my family later that night a well maybe it wa with the confidence i now carried or the manner in which i whipped out my wallet but they seemed to finally recognize me a an adult my sister even said a much life seemed beautiful i had hope for the first time in a long time that everything would turn out okay me and mandy were disgustingly in love she offered to drop her fwb when she saw how i felt and we became exclusive of course we never formally dated because e-dating wa a thing only stupid people did we had a grand plan though a book it initially began a a generic sappy love story meant to be hurled onto amazon for a few quick book but we had genuinely good idea over our brainstorming session which quickly evolved into a truly interesting book i wa the writer and she wa the editor we were going to be a cute writer couple with our name together on bookshelf and after that how could we not be together i wa n't good at much but i envisioned living together with her learning basic mechanical skill from her handy father learning to draw better everything but i became complacent lazy she pleaded with me to write more we were n't going nearly a fast a we hoped i want to be with you now she said and you know what i fucking did i played video game i had writer 's block i had difficulty getting the word out so instead of putting forth more effort i delved back into escapism there were inbred son to disinherit in crusader king cavalry charge to be executed in mount and blade and an oppressed earth to be liberated in x-com tension grew where we once thought we could resolve any dispute through talking we began to fight more and more often she discussed one of her ex-fwbs being a nuisance in his messaging i dismissed it for i wa still a little envious and that wa it the straw that broke the camel 's back she left thing started to fall apart for me my constant procrastination in school caught up with me i wa on the borderline of failing and my disappointed family quickly demoted me back to infanthood i had drifted away with some of my friend both real life and online and one of my closest simply left entirely a well i had only my english teacher who i fear i will not see after i graduate in the span of two month i 've fully regressed back to the hellish junior year and lost everything i have n't touched my console in age and i 've deleted all my game from my computer i do n't consume any medium i put reddit on a ten minute timer a day timer that lock me out afterwards which i only violate for this post i do n't watch television i do n't watch movie i quit sugary drink and junkfood i do n't even jack off anymore i even intermittently fast only for a day at time a my father would become suspicious if i missed anymore meal than that i deny myself everything i now spend my day pacing writing walking in the park reading nabakov and other author and sleeping but it 's too late i lost it all and now i 'm seriously considering ending it i do n't have a gun in reach but i 'm waiting to save up a little bit of money for another way,1

my mental health ha n't been the best a of late although i have been taking step to make it better i 've been taking my med and going to therapy every tuesday but i always feel like i ca n't talk to people about my issue outside of that mainly my issue with companionship and feeling alone my roommate now treat me a if i 'm a child or they just seem to ignore me no one take me seriously i mean i 'm and my parent still have to remind me about basic thing like getting homework done or taking out the trash or having enough money to pay the bill i 'm not late on any assignment or paying any of my bill the worst part i believe is the relationship i 'm surrounded by and my lack-there-of every time i hear that one of my friend ha a new partner or they 're getting married or they talk about how great their life are with this special person i want to immediately leave the room and lock myself away i 've had a bad relationship with love and to hear that people are finding it just fine make me feel like i 'm not worth anything it 's been so long since i 've been held or even felt like someone liked me in a romantic way and of course i ca n't tell people how lonely i feel because they 'll say the same stuff like oh you 'll find someone you 'll find that special person soon i ca n't stand it anymore i wish i could fast forward to the next year of my life where i 'll be out of school and having everything figured out,1
i woke up today wanting to die i wa planning on doing it after school so i decided school wa pointless to go to i walked to the mall by my school and went to a kneader 's and ordered french toast french toast ha always been my favorite so i figured it would be a good last thing to eat i pondered a ton about my life and what it is i really want i felt super empty but also my mind wa racing with thought i had convinced myself i needed to finish my life today i had been thinking for about half an hour when an elderly man sat across from me and gave me a hot chocolate he said that he ordered it for me because he could tell i needed it he told me i do n't know what you 're going through but life will get better and then he left and then i cried and now i 'm back at school and i think i want to live edit thank you to everyone who responded to this and messaged me and just were so kind,1
my last post i posted here two week ago and because of some kind word from stranger i decided not to kill myself it 's been two week and nothing ha changed i feel even more isolated and alone i spend most of my day trying to hold back tear i have no one i am sick of being an outcast i 'm sick of being a weirdo i ca n't do this anymore i 've tried there 's no place for me in this world life doe n't get better for people like me i have no worth i have no family i have no one i feel like death is my only option to escape this pain i do n't when i 'm going to do it but all i know is i 'm going to kill myself sometime soon,1

unrequited love bringing me to suicidal thought this is probably going to sound really stupid so there s this guy let s call him e. e is my best friend and i m his best friend we hang out decently often and our friendship is honestly the best thing i have but i am also in love with him it hurt like hell because he s literally the cutest nicest most amazing guy i ve ever met in my life and i honestly want to spend the rest of my life with him and i care about him deeply but i know for a fact he ll never feel the same way i forgot to mention i m a male and e is also a male he s very accepting when it come to homosexuality but he s straight that s the problem i m in love with my straight best friend the fact that i can never be with him literally hurt like no other feeling i ve ever felt in my life i just can t take it he s so amazing and it just hurt man i often find myself thinking about suicide if i can never be with such a beautiful person a him then i don t really see the point in living because that s honestly the only thing i want in my life so i m already a failure in life what s the point of living with all this pain what s the point of living if i can never truly be happy with the one person i love,1

i 'm messed up for a long a i can remember i have lashed out at people who probably care about me excluding family my family doe n't know out of fear of being someone that is disposable in their life in other word i give people a reason to leave so that i 'm not surprised when they do i regret every word i say but they just keep coming a a first year student in university i made a large group of friend and had a particularly close relationship with one of those friend we spent countless night getting to know each other and so many personal detail about each other and we were basically inseparable this person ha since become the fourth person in a many year who decided that they were bored of me after i became emotionally dependent upon them since this happened i have spent the last couple of month of my first year at university personally attacking all of my friend that i made here now i know everyone is sick of me and no matter how badly i want to apologize every time i think to do so a fear so strong grip me and i ca n't help but to lash out again anyways what is wrong with me i care so deeply about all of these people and yet i continue to drive them away why do i do this to myself i hate who i am i hate having to live with myself i thought i had gotten over my depression and had recovered completely from my first suicide attempt several year ago but i 'm back to regretting every morning that i wake up every night that i survive instead of passing away in my sleep i do n't want to deal with me anymore i have n't wanted to in year but the fact that not even going to school in a different country ha changed how horrible i am convinces me that i do n't deserve to be here anymore,1

looking into his eye this past weekend trying my hardest to be present trying my hardest to be in the place that i wa in just a few month ago where i loved him with my whole body heart soul i loved deeply and undoubtedly without question or want for change i am manually reminding myself to appreciate the good thing between u i am purposefully redirecting my attention to the positive thing i am forcing myself to forget the thing that inspired the reason for wanting change i wanted change i wanted a life on my own to figure out my own way to do everything on my own to experience a part of life and the world without any inhibition or circumstance i 've tried to break down the black and white perspective that my therapist told me i use i 'm trying to apply change that i want while we remain together in this relationship we 've been together since i wa eighteen year old thirteen year last september i 've never experienced independence or had a chance to figure out how to quit drinking or handle money better without being in the symbiotic/codependent relationship when i look at him the first thing that come to my mind are thing that i wished were different a i slowly and subtly bring them up i know that he is listening and trying to change he love me wholly he doe n't want to change me i do n't want to throw away everything that we 've built i do n't want our story to be over i do n't want to live without him in my life but i fear that the dissolution of my eternal and unconditional love is inevitable and unstoppable i felt a pang of guilt last night because i knew that i am no longer returning the same depth of affection he give me or what he wa previously used to i am internally distraught and conflicted ambivalent i am fighting it for u i may get over this it 's been four month of fighting it but i am still trying i am not giving up on u we may be able to get past this i am trying to stop it i am trying my hardest,1

i 've destroyed everything i 'm year old and i feel like i 've run a far a i can life ha been a series of crash followed by pipe dream followed by another crash i 've run out of resource and lie to keep me cocooned and i 'm living in a very ugly reality i 'm almost completely withdrawn from the world and have become a recluse i still have a job somehow but i hate it and am terrible at it every day it cause me massive anxiety i 'm so hyper defensive and unmotivated it make me sick all i 'm doing is the most basic of human operation i 'm alive and that 's about it there is no pleasure no joy no warmth time ha changed i feel like i 'm living the same day over and over again like the world ha left me behind i barely know what 's going on around me and have an extremely hard time following conversation i hunger for social interaction but have lost the limited social skillset i had i 'm afraid of nearly everyone and i feel coldness and hostility from people i 'm living in my own head nearly constantly every day i 'm on the edge i have no more trick or tactic to hide myself from myself the booze stopped working along with everything else i 've created this situation myself through the year but even if i deserve this it doe n't mean i can accept it i think to myself what would happen if i won million dollar and the answer is nothing would change so what else can i do but end this it 's insane but i 'm cornered all i can think to do is confess in a letter to try and explain myself and then go ahead and do this,1

the jelly belly jelly bean flavor ranked i am somewhat concerned a to how exactly jelly belly make their jelly bean because typically the artificial flavor of the bean are so strong that it is overwhelming but necessary if you are eating a variety so that any one flavor can be completely erased from your palette when popping in the next my mom had got me a small box of jelly bean for easter a variety pack of conventional flavor and i have n't really eaten these thing in year so i thought i 'd dip back into my childhood and try them out wa interested to see that old favorite became today 's garbage and the flavor i used to be meh about have come to the top of my list because i m kind of drunk and bored i will share list of favorite jelly belly jelly bean from the worst bean to the best licorice i have yet to understand who actually enjoys licorice i understand back in the olden day there wasn t a much of a variety of flavor so licorice candy maybe wa tolerable alongside like star anise and such i don t know how different today s licorice extract candy is to the licorice flavoring of yesteryear but it is abrasive and borderline obscene i wonder if at the jelly belly lab scientist did any form of outreach to have kid taste their bean to evaluate which one stay in circulation if they did then they would throw licorice out however i have a hunch that jelly belly is one of the few corporation that even buy the root anymore and the licorice industry will surely die off without such a loyal customer i would hate for licorice farmer to lose their job over the retirement of this bean flavor so maybe it s for the best that this bean stay the licorice jelly bean is a deceptively dark a the blueberry jelly bean so i would have to bite the bean first and get a hint of the horrid flavor so i could know to throw this one away in hind sight blueberry isn t good enough to where this method wa worth it i should have thrown out all dark jelly bean for my own well bean hahahahahah get it ok tutti-frutti when i wa a young warthog i used to love this fucking flavor i d single out the colorful bean and eat them all last you know save the best for last and stuff it s a pretty thing to look at i ll be honest the pink with flake of blue and red a mini mosaic tile sadly getting older i ve completely lost the taste for this hyper sugary flavor it s it s almost like bubble gum a flavor i ve also gotten sick of i couldn t do it honestly i threw these in the garbage a well thankfully easier to pick out than licorice bubble gum no surprise there but what is a surprise is that these bean don t even taste like bubble gum tutti-frutti taste more like bubble gum this is just…off askew it unnerves me cotton candy the pink bean are also suspect and again i don t know what the hell they thought they were going for but it doesn t taste like any cotton candy i ve ever had isn t that bad of a bean but the marketing kind of piss me off very cherry very should be replaced with violent yeah that is a better adjective this bean is violently cherry flavored in the jungle bright color on animal are sometimes a warning sign of poison or toxicity i should have recognized the literal red flag that is the overwhelming red of this bean seriously the color is concentrated redness but of course artificial cherry candy flavored and so it kind of made me think of cough syrup blueberry similarly this is…violently blue not blueberry this bean doesn t taste like a berry it taste blue didn t think blue wa a flavor think again the jelly belly scientist have found a way to extract the flavor of blue and condense it into jelly bean form is it worth it it s ok i guess but off putting watermelon a favorite summer moment is getting to sit out on the patio feel the wind blow over me and look at the tree and the vibrancy of the grass and snack on grape and watermelon i like watermelon this bean is not watermelon i don t know what actual flavor the artificial watermelon candy extract try to emulate but it is so far removed from the actual fruit that every bean i ate made me long for those summer day for the juiciness and natural flavor of a true watermelon i can not wait for those day to return here green apple what is with these fruit jelly bean they are almost a mockery of the fruit which they imitate though it doe taste very green there is a bit more of a nod toward actual apple flavor the citrus fruit peach orange sherbet sunkist® lemon sunkist® tangerine lemon lime and peach all fall in the middle of the list because all are equally boring ironic because citrus fruit have vibrant flavor here i just feel meh i feel so bored every time i d pop a yellow or orange bean into my mouth i d think oh boy i bet this will pucker the lip a bit and i feel numbness inside of me because i think i am a grown man eating jelly bean alone in his room i have nothing much to say about each individual flavor by the way i have been calling orange sherbet orange sher-bert for year now year no one ha corrected me i had to type sherbert and get the red squiggly line to alert me that something wa wrong sizzling cinnamon the common theme you will see a i get closer to one is that for the most part the more artificial the flavor is the more i enjoy it which seems counter intuitive to me i felt that a an adult i would like the fruit one more i think rather i appreciate when candy is trying to be candy and not pretending to be fruit filled the cinnamon one is good make me think of big red which i enjoy or like those mint juicy pear an exception to the fruit hate the actual bean look a bit sickly it make me think of the booger flavored bean in harry potter however somehow it work somehow it doe feel like a bite of a juicy pear but better than a pear because pear themselves are somewhat boring so the added sugar make it higher on the list than most other fruit strawberry cheesecake impressionism wa an art movement where painter would create scene that weren t fully fledged out in detail literally giving you an impression of a scene more than that it wa their subjective impression of a scene a well similar trait can be heard in the music of debussy and ravel who paint using music to portray impression of greek myth of foreign land etc etc i would say this bean is impressionist it clearly isn t a cheesecake but you get the hint of strawberry you get the hint of the dessert and it is almost into the uncanny valley something is off but it s ok. this bean wa probably crafted by an artist from this point forward i m willing to say these bean are more example of impressionism in food art coconut the last fruit in the bundle and it s the best the white bean is a treasure so simple and calming like white foam over the wave like sand like well a coconut biting into this make me think of sun lotion of being by the pool of taking in the warmth of the sun a bite-sized vacation pina colada this will follow coconut in description eating the cocktail themed bean make me think of puerto rico and indulging in treat i can t normally get here at home feeling more relaxed and happy to be away from it all another vacation themed bean toasted marshmallow i don t want to know how the jelly belly scientist were able to extract the flavor of toasted a well a marshmallow and make it work in a way that isn t overwhelming it is just right just the right hint of toastiness and marshmallowness it doe make me think of campfire of looking up at the star of shivering in the cold ghost stories…somehow all of my favorite october memory a a child is recreated through one bean kudos and finally the king of bean buttered popcorn i do not understand how this flavor got to the top of the list from just the name alone it feel like a warning sign saccharine unnatural wrong but somehow somehow the genius scientist were able to make an icon of movie theater popcorn and by icon i don t mean like the iconic well known flavor i mean how the orthodox use it an ikon is a depiction of god in art and this bean is an ikon of movie theater popcorn i don t understand how they were able to make a transcendent flavor like this the scientist nay artist who craft this bean probably ha a loving family he or she is probably fulfilled in life sleep peacefully if not you deserve it sir or madam you deserve the good thing that happen in your life the life the light the love in me honor the life light and love in you and so end my time-killer for the day i hope you…enjoy this also if anyone from the jelly belly corporation is carousing social medium for marketing research or whatever and the title of this post trigger you to read it know that i will be ready to promote your bean on this site in exchange for a lifetime supply of the following flavor buttered popcorn toasted marshmallow pina colada coconut strawberry cheesecake every licorice bean in circulation the last isn t because i want to eat them god no but rather i want to save others from having to come across them,0

there is nothing more self seeking than the posting of the following text but here it go it seems likely that anything said here will amount to nothing both in it initial installment and in the unlikely event someone take the time to read it and responds via a comment it aftereffect this likely sound like the beginning of many such post regarding depression and in truth it is the same but i should clarify off the bat that i do n't believe in depression speaking to those who did n't leave this post after that blasphemous profession i should also clarify that i do have sympathy for those who claim to have depression a i also exhibit those symptom that they claim are indicative of this so called mental illness i hate myself i hate the world i hate my life and life itself existence is my abhorrence i sleep all day and stay up all night i have no motivation my youthful curiosity at my tender age of have all but died along with my passion i have no hobby and i medicate myself with pornography outburst of anger medium and the occasional belittling of other people 's life job and feeling but these are not symptom of a mental illness depression is not a real condition if you could rap up the whole problem of depression from which truly emanates all other symptom the issue life in our hopelessness hopelessness alone can cause depression i have seen it in many where the thought of the end of all thing a truly possible prospect brings someone to their knee the loss of a girlfriend brings the hopelessness of the painful type of solitude the loss of a job brings the hopelessness of destitution and abandonment the death of a loved one brings the hopelessness of never being able to fill that spot of love again however i think the far more potent and increasingly more common root of such hopelessness grows from a lack of purpose many people go though scenario such a the one i listed above and move out of depression but this is because they have experienced shortly the pain which purposelessness give in an everlasting flow life without purpose is purely futile if one can not find a purpose then they will slump into these symptom which people believe is some mental illness it is a lie to call it a mental illness because you ca n't heal a lack of purpose anti-depressants ca n't give you a reason to live and so many of u slowly become worse year of this feeling take their toll and create an exponential effect of the weight of hopelessness leading u if not stopped somewhere along the way to the prerogative of self-termination for those like myself i can only imagine we are still alive because we are just waiting on the courage to kill ourselves i ca n't say i 'm there yet but the year are beginning to take their toll and i do n't know how long i can hold off thought of this nature so this is my predicament a tonight i reflect on how much i hate being alive and slowly let my mind drift to scenario so dark i can not say them here i will likely wake up tomorrow and feel foolish that i ever said a word but i feel too horrible right now to not say something and truly there is nothing more self serving than this,1

struggling hey everyone i want to die i guess that s why i m here isn t it i 20f wa married to a good man 22m he wasn t perfect but he wa good i wa good too but i have intense anxiety and it showed through out our marriage i wa depressed and wanting to commit suicide a lot and cutting it scared him so he would stay often with another friend in another town he wa not there for me and the time he wa he wa either very angry for me for what i wa going through or holding me down to try to get me to calm down he talked down to me a lot but i blame this on our overall lack of respect for each other he also threw the divorce word around a lot starting month after getting married eventually this began to turn into abuse and when he would get angry he would hold me down and yell at me when he wa generally angry one day thing got out of control and he wouldn t let me go or get away from him and cop were called and he wa booked it broke my heart and i didn t know charge would file after that we had an nco against our will yet we still talked because we both felt horrible about the situation when i would have intense anxiety about what he told people back home about what happened with his arrest i thought they hated me for him going to jail and i would threaten to report we were talking it wasn t right or okay and i feel horrible to this day for it he finally said for the final time he wanted a divorce and it didn t really sink in for a few month at the time we were living in separate area and he refused to see me i begged him to give u a chance and to help u get counseling we d only been married for just over a year but he refused he wanted out he began hanging out with this girl that he had taken nude photo of without telling me while we were married he doe photography they were hanging out a lot and by the time he had finally filed for divorce it had been month since he asked for it so i wa stuck in limbo for a long time i got addicted to trying to ask him to stay he started dating her and hid it from me so we signed divorce paper and i wa obsessed with social medium trying to figure out answer of if my suspicion were true they were of course and over the course of fighting he finally said yesterday for the 100th time he hope he never speaks to me again guy at this point i m getting divorced but i feel so defeated the more i fought the more he resisted you can t change someone but i feel like disposed trash i truly loved that guy and i m struggling with him moving on in a matter of month and not even giving our relationship a chance just texting me that he wa done and that wa it i also feel embarrassed because i have dragged it in his eye he didn t value marriage so it wa a break up for me i expected u to sit down and talk and actually try to address stuff and it didn t happen so i think me dragging it wa simply that unhappiness for lack of closure i m struggling hard with suicide i feel a though i can t be loved a someone saw me for the thing i struggled with and immediately walked out and who could love a divorced woman i have a hard time with the lying and manipulation towards the end of him lying about dating someone else that one i struggle so hard with because she is literally perfect for him and it make me angry and depressed that i fought so hard for his attention and love and someone walk into his life and get it effortlessly it seems i feel it all on my shoulder and am struggling immensely,1
i hit karma i woke up this morning and obviously the first thing i do is go on reddit then i saw that i had karma exactly i m just so excited i lurked for pretty much a whole year not really commenting anything and until a few week ago i don t think i even had karma the thing i ve learned is that if you find something funny don t hesitate to post/comment it odds are other people will find it funny too,0
what the martian government would be like i had a thought in the shower about distant future when human will colonise mar and possibly other planet in an optimistic scenario where we are able to solve/postpone the problem of global climate change nuclear war etc assuming that global political and economical system is more or le the same maybe more civility what would be the legal and political ground for martian society private company like spacex probably will be on the forefront of exploration with state agency tailing them closely so the first stations/settlements probably will be organized by a bunch of different state and private agent like i and operate in the same framework but the astro/kosmonauts on i only stay for a short time and even then u and russian space agency basically decide everything for them permanent settler would probably want to have a voice in development of the colony but imagine if spacex funded of the mission and sent permanent settler whereas nasa shelled out for another and sent would they all have the same vote or spacexers will be more valuable so to speak moreover what if someone commits a crime while in such a colony with no police and united legal framework maritime law how the punishment or retribution will be decided upon furthermore people would probably engage in some sort of economic exchange how and through what could it be regulated and should it be regulated history provides is with some perspective on distant colony where people dumped something/someone they did not want that much sorry oz a well a resource-valuable colony government and private company competed for but martian situation is quite different from both or not what kind of culture sentiment towards mainland and it separated government life in such colony would create will tribalism prevail or people considering they would be mostly scientist and engineer unite together and will china send it secret police agent masked a a scientist to ensure taikonauts do not stray too far from mao 's way i swear this is a plot for sci-fi comedy tv series writing itself there are question that really made me think i do understand it is a bit speculative but i have n't seen these issue being really discussed in sci-fi or more serious book a lot we mostly hear about engineering and computational feature that would allow u to travel to the star and nog enough about new social and cultural form that will arise a a result of human leaving the cradle i am an esl sorry if my language wa a bit wonky i have some idea about these issue and will share if people are interested introduce your point suggestion and idea about taming the red planet tldr in non-utopian realistic future how the martian colony would function from the legal and political perspective how they are going to exchange favour and punish criminal how they will decide if pizza printer should have pineapple cartridge or not,0

music=photo what ok so i commented on a thread yesterday about something i thought would be a little more common and maybe it 's i have no idea i 'm an amature musician and have a passion for pc gaming too so it 's fairly common to listen to music and play game at the same time that 's basically a given tbh however that 's not my question my question is doe anyone else ever feel like there getting something i 've nick name music triggered nostalgia ok hear me out i know it 's a bit wierd and cheesy i used to read a lot when i wa younger and alot of the time i wa reading i wa listening to music usually one while album through to the end usually i 'd listen to the album more than once while reading the same book i also used to just listen to music doing basically everything too so sometimes spotify will throw out one of the song of those album and it 's like someone flick a light switch on or open a door into the plot of that book or the scene or activity i wa doing at the time it 's very vivid and i can sometimes even picture the line of the book and what i depicted the scene a so in short i 'm asking is there anyone that know anymore about this or experience this thanks for reading it i know i 'm not very good at writing clearly,0
i think that is a good suicide note do n't you think so ok well let 's see let 's explain myself a bit so you will feel good after i suicide imagine a table the table is clean nothing wrong with it it 's super clean now here is what is going on with me i see the table and i see it clean but i have to stare at it for a minute or so then i see it 's not clean i 'm pretty sure it 's a hallucination but here is the best part if there is someone nearby to help me i will ask the person if the table is clean or not the person answer it 's clean and i say are you sure the person answer yes now that help slightly but now i got ta assume it 's clean while it 's not because i 'm not seeing it 's clean i can tell if it 's real or not the fact that it 's not clean- now i got ta do compulsive behavior for hour to clean that table and eventually will end up free from obsessive thought or realize it 's still unclean and panic because all my energy is drained and i ca n't take it anymore and when i panic i gon na scream internally end it please whoever is there god or the simulation manager or whoever made this shit up that is not fing fair and i 'm not a tool to prove or to test upon i had enough f the system i ca n't take it anymore i ca n't i just ca n't i do n't care if you say i 'm weak pathetic and you have to fight it or whatever you do n't understand you are just being either a ignorant about my suffering b selfish that you do n't want me to rest in peace so you do n't have to get depressed about my death c you are just following the stupid system this is like my suicide note okay if you guy should feel anything about this is that i had enough i ca n't take it and if you reached to here that mean you care about what i 'm saying i hope you understand because i let you down many time and the final let down gon na end all of this i do n't know what to say anymore sorry about grammatical or spelling problem i just feel down,1
i just don t want to feel nothing anymore i m a year old middle school student my family is neither going through or ha gone through hard time i don t have severe anxiety or depression i have never taken medicine in my life i am a middle class citizen with a house in the suburb of colorado i have everything i could possibly need and most thing that i want i have zero friend and really the only people i talk to are my parent which i suppose is part of the problem i write story and post them online where people can read them i m part of several video game community and play many video game the issue here is the one people always neglect to see when they say that i m privileged i feel completely empty inside void of most emotion besides boredom and tiredness when my parent yell at me for doing something wrong i don t feel sad or regretful neither angry or pissed off this started a couple year ago when i wa about it s gotten to the point where i now have to fake emotion like happy excited or sad i taught myself how to cry whenever i needed to when my grandma died around new year last year i still felt nothing even though i wa close to her i m not completely sure what to do about it i ve had thought of suicide but have never had to chance to go through with my plan at one point in my life i tried to hang myself off of my closet but the bar snapped before i could end it i also had previous issue with cutting i still have the scar on my leg and they refuse to go away they are a constant reminder of my both ignorance and selfishness i m a privileged white bitch with everything i could possibly want need anything i just don t think anyone will really understand how i feel i ve posted this online before and got called an attention whore and a disgrace to humanity i really don t think i can handle this anymore but i m to much a fucking coward to end it,1
why do i hate myself so much,1
normally my mother or aunt is helping me shower since i 'm terrified of showering and usually am forced to bathe i just do n't feel like i 'm worthy of bathing but today i wa home alone and i decided to shower today by myself it felt scary but great i usually am terrified i 'll fall or drown or some weird crap but today i did it alone,1
i ve been depressed for quite some time and possibly since i wa a child because i experienced being molested by my grade school teacher and witnessed a lot of domestic violence and been abused a well and depression run in both side of my family and both my parent have it but i m now and i ve turned a lot to spiritualism and basically leaning on my spirit guide for comfort and balance but i still get day especially it being winter where i am so depressed and my depression show in my irritability and anxiety my disinterest to a lot of thing lot of cry spell and just being down and gloomy and my boyfriend try and help but recently he s been really starting to tell me how ive been annoyed a lot these past few month and how he only want to help me and even said if he could to let me take out all my frustration on him if it would help but he s really beginning to let my depression affect him i never once thought to myself that this wasn t going to happen bc it doe eventually but i just want to know what i can do to help from taking it out on him because it s not intentional and i try i swear i try like when i get moody and i realize and quickly try and snap myself out of it before i do any damage because i do love him and i care for him but i dont want him thinking this should be our battle because i ve been battling this before we met and i tell him how he doesn t have to stick around and ill understand and i will like i can never get mad at someone putting themselves first i just wan na know what i can do to help stop me from putting this on him and how i can cope and let my battle of depression and love for him and u coexist smoothly,1

i 've had depression for quite some time now i find it extremely hard to get motivation to do really anything but that wa usually just it most the time i wa just sitting here when random a fuck a thought popped into my head can i picture my future can i see myself somehow doing a job related to my study at all can i see myself settling down with someone i thought about it and i tried hard but could n't think of anything for some reason this just made me so depressed like no sadness i 've ever felt before i sat in my room cry silently for probably min i started trying to find people or post with similar issue and found a few post but they were older thought i 'd post here and ask if anyone feel the same or if anyone ha and ha any advice i just felt like i had to get this out somehow like i have no one to talk to about this stuff really,1
girlfriend left me because she 's depressed now i 'm even more depressed than i wa before i met her and it 's all piling up so yesterday my now exgf said i need to focus on myself because of mental health issue she 's been struggling with for year do n't get me wrong i understand that she doe n't want to waste emotional energy on me she need to take care of herself first and foremost but for a good six month she wa a big reason why i did n't start cutting again or try to kill myself now that she 's gone wtf do i do there 's a physical pain i have and i do n't know how to deal with it i contemplated cutting again i 'm in the process of giving myself a stick n poke tattoo just doing some outline work on a rising sun definitely contemplated killing myself my girlfriend left me my gpa start with a i 'm probably going to be evicted because my job ha n't been giving me enough hour oh and my best friend ha pof and cancer all i possibly have to look forward to is a dance show in may that i 've working on for a few month now and my motorcycle license later this month have no money so it 's kind of pointless i 've been working on being a dickhead to my family so they do n't miss me when i 'm gone there 's a ringing in my ear i ca n't quiet down and these problem do n't have solution,1
viewpoint on suicide if i make this an analogy like by comparing this to lgbtq+ right maybe that 'll help it 's my right to die if i want to imo a long a it 's non impulsive just like it 's lgbtq+ people 's right to get married altho it can be argued that coming out will make other ppl sad bc it harm them spiritually or mentally or smthg weird dumb like that we 'd say no bc it only matter how the lgbtq+ person itself feel bc it 's their desicion so altho you may think suicide is harmful for them it 's my choice i wo n't force you to marry the same gender if you do n't want to i just want you to let myself do it in the same way i do n't want to kill everyone just myself i rlly do n't care if you want to do smthg that take a lot of effort is completely pointless like have fun i totally understand that you want to take full advantage of life bc why not i have a chance to so might a well but i just want to be allowed to leave i had a right to life now i ask for a right to death i 'll prob wait until i 'm tho if i still feel the same way then tho i may purposefully be more clumsy in the meantime i 'll try not to stage it a a suicide bc i do n't want others to feel bad despite the fact it 's my descion like i already argued so altho i do n't have to this part is just optional i 'll make it seem like an accident maybe get into a car crash or smthg but it doe n't rlly matter if anyone feel bad bc they will die too this is just my opinion tho you cld also make it an analogy to woman 's right or aborting or literally anything like that like i said before a long a it 's non impulsive it shld be allowed i 'm not the only one who recognizes the fact that they just do n't want to live life is n't bad like there 's no problem but i just do n't want to it 's useless nobody gain anything from it so you can if you want but i 'll pas at most our society that we 've created is just a solution to boredom why am i being forced to stupid peer pressure to live my own cowardice to go against society are the only thing stopping me from doing it rn tbh but at least once i 'm it can be a car accident or smthg i wo n't feel bad i cant wait until society realizes this instead of shaming u or telling u that we 're selfish they help u give u painless quick way to do it or let u do it without worrying about how others think it 'll affect u or smthg i 'm not scared by the pain bc i 'll be dead haha we 're all gon na die anyway i 'm just gon na choose when make sure it 's my own choice i 'm only shaving off some year anyway i guess i 'll miss out on some experience but i am totally cool with that but thanks for wondering i 'm really not curious at all i 'd rather just skip out on that it 's pointless meaningless anyway even if you believe that there is some sort of a purpose irdc about it irdc about anything tbh bc it 'll all go away anyway i tried to explain my viewpoint to the best of my ability btw i 'm not saying everyone shld die just those who want to non impulsively shld be allowed to i have the right for my life i also have the right for my death my way,1

update so i thought it would only be fair to post this update while one friend still doesn t seem to give a fuck i m meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow turn out she s been having a thyroid flare up one other friend also want to make lunch plan soon so we ll see about that some people care but have stuff going on other people don t care pay more attention to the former original post seriously fuck everyone it s so easy to say after someone end their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked but who s really willing to listen only a select few of u are blessed with friend who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way the rest of them are just faffers capitalism ha rotten human relationship to the core and everything ha become disposable including friendship hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk more often than not it s people who have struggled with mental illness themselves edit it is usually better to talk to a therapist if you can afford therapy that is about issue that friend do not have the professional training to deal with i do n't recommend burdening other people with all your issue because that would just drive them away people have enough shit in their own life to deal with however it suck if you want to talk with a 'friend who clearly know you 're going through a tough time and they do n't return your call edit looking back at my post i realise i sound a little angry and cynical but i really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need a big part of that is also having access to mental health professional who are capable and helpful if you can please seek the help of a therapist it ha helped me realize where my boundary with others lie and how i can strengthen my own self to ask of others what i need/deserve from them it can be a long-drawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt but please persevere if you have the mean thanks to everyone for your comment i m trying to reply to each one but it s hard to keep up so i m sorry if i miss yours remember—you re worth the effort and the struggle so please hang in there edit if you 're in the u uk canada or au you can use this directory to find a therapist near you read about them what insurance they take etc http wwwpsychologytodaycomustherapists,1
story time bear with me im sure you can write a drama series with this my mother told me recently that when i wa year old my father wa on the binge and called me a whipster she told me she never saw me cry so hard a a child i become quiet and withdrawn i don t remember ever hanging out with my dad i do remember vividly my mom asking me not to tell kid at school that he got a drinking problem my mother tried to shield me from the abuse she would lock me in my room along with my sister and we would blast loud music or if it became worse we would run away to my grandparent house on the other side of the town he wasn t drinking all the time he wa an on/off alki.when he stopped the binge he would apologize to my mom and beg her to come back and she did because she loved him i wa bullied in school and my father would never step in it wa either my mom or my sister which seemed to make the matter worse for me i never had any self esteem when i wa i witnessed my mom having her head slammed against the ground by my father in a delirious state from an alcohol withdrawal he denied everything after it took my grandparent and my 15yo sister to pull him off her alcoholism is so common i always tried to rationalise what wa happening but it doesn t change the fact the ordeal left me broken some day i would clutch my chest and chant i don t want to die must have been a sign of something my mother had been given an opportunity to work abroad for a better pay and she took it promising to bring u over lying to my father that she will come back and left u for one year everything seemed normal but the next year we had found out that my father wa cheating on my mom and had thrown u out it wa the very first time i stood up to him i wa so angry that he did that that i demolished my room with spray paint before we left i wa staying with my grand parent after that my father would often meet me and give me a lot of money he tried to use me a a bargain chip in the divorce i wa something broke inside me about that time i started to skip school whole month and go to my father place to play computer game at his i wa found out and my grandparent were furious with me and with him he didn t care i didn t go to school i even met his lover at some point i wa really resentful with my grandparent that they argued with me every day and beat me from time to time i think that wa onset of my anxiety and depression about that time i had my first and unrequited love the pattern of humility and abandonment would continue despite my genuine feeling i become a laughing stock of my school because of the school skiving so leaving the country wa a clean slate i needed it turned out my mother had a serious car accident and needed a face reconstruction surgery she wa stopping tear at the phone when i begged her to take me over to her the accident the hopelessness being away from family the divorce and everything in between must have taken a toll on her and she wa depressed too she wa very irritable and would somehow viciously take it out on me break my xbox game etc moving country wa everything i ever wanted a dream come true everything wa so different i didn t know english very well at the time and because of my upbringing i found it i could not fit in very well i insisted i did not need help from school that i wil learn english myself i eventually did but there were a lot of awkward conversation where either side wa misunderstood when i told my mom i couldn t focus on my study she would mock me so i stopped talking to her about my problem she would often cry that i hate her etc on one hand she gave me a horrible childhood and upbringing on the other hand she sacrificed her health and herself to provide for u when i wa i fell in love with a girl who had a boyfriend a typical friend zone scenario she wa the only girl in school that thought im not a total weirdo so naturally i started to like her i did love her sincerely and tried to do anything i could so she could change her mind about her boyfriend and me she seemed to enjoy the attention and would sometimes fuel my jelousy by telling me about him that driven me to suicide i oculd not handle the rejection and humiliation one day i told myself that i will tell her that i love her and if she doesn t say she love me back i will kill myself she wa late to class so i attempted suicide i wa quickly saved and admitted to a mental hospital she did visit me and everything but after a whil ei decided to cut all tie with her realising how toxic that relationship wa i failed my exam and wa on the dole history like to repeat itself a i soon found out .i didn t find any reason to live so i thought that by living for someone else someone i fall in love with i will find some kin dof newfound energy to carry on to start to take care of myself i know now it doesn t work like that which make me even sadder a it feel like a lost cause to carry on with my unhappy life fast forward a few year i started working and fell in love with a girl at work who wa emotionally unavailable noticing the pattern i decided to spare myself the pain and tried to commit suicide she saved me from killing myself but wa very distant after that about that time my mother wa going out with a guy and it turned out he had an emotional baggage a well a hi sfather wa a heavy drinker he tried to be a father figure to me but i didn t need a father figure since i wa at the time especially since he had such a twisted idea of being a father he used intimidation tactic and wa very manipulative he would tell me im worthless and have no job and just a parasite and then tell my mom we talked thing out worst thing is nobody would believe me at the time since i would lie about the smallest thing just so they would leave me alone but they did eventually funny how he moaned about me not having a job but when i eventually got it he found some other excuse i wa playing computer game when he pulled the internet plug demanding to know why i didn t help him repair my mother phone i explained to him why but he wouldn t take that for an answer and kept asking the same question it wa some kind of weird abuse tactic when my mom came back from work she noticed what went down and slapped him he shoved her on the ground so i threatened him and then he went for me i wa surprisingly calm like i wa ready for this moment my whole life deep down i promised myself i would not let my family be hurt again this way i kept him at an arm length without punching him and my mother and sister pulled him off me eventually he calmed down when he realised i told my mom to get the neighbour police came round and he got done for assault on me we had to sell the house worst thing is i felt more distressed about the girl than having to fight my stepdad i loved her so much i tried everything in my power so that she would like me back i never had any friend so i would buy my work colleague souvenir and stuff a a token of good will but that only seemed to make them jealous that i get to go to usa and stuff i feel worthless empty humiliated i don t belong anywhere my genuine love wa perceived a lecherous manipulation by the girl peer nothing bring happiness anymore in my life i wish i were dead i m going to a therapist right now but i m not sur eif it will help in the medium men are often portrayed a fantasising about money car gadget i wish i had friend and someone i could rely on a girl to cuddle it get worse every day i no longer shave or shower im horrible to my family i lock myself in my room and sleep after work i didn t ask to be born ill be patient and see what another day brings,1
idk why but all of the sudden i felt super anxious and felt like something bad wa going to happen either to me or someone else i do n't know why or what to do about it,1
why do i feel so alone there are the obvious reason i should be sad—the health of my mother and my inability to cope with or understand the decision she made to forego treatment and accept death a an inevitability—but i should n't feel alone she love me i love her we 're both 'in love yet here i sit like a specter haunting a home he used to call his own existing unheard waiting for others to cross over and join me in a world i do n't understand nothing make sense and although i know i 'm loved and i know how to love i simply feel empty and alone,1

do n't misunderstand this title please i am by no mean saying depression is any kind of privilege suggesting you can use 'the depression card or whatnot my point is that i feel my problem are irrelevant because i know there are a lot of people out there who suffer worse than me i feel i am not in a position to complain yet i do n't feel content i feel more apathy than much else and i do n't know if that is depression and i am too stubborn to seek help for a diagnosis some part of me belief i can solve this on my own but another part asks and how long will that take considering your le than stellar situation will and mindset oh and then there 's the part which definitely think i should n't waste my time writing this which in turn may waste your time by reading this i am just confused and a little tired i seek no sympathy from you guy but maybe someone can relate i wish you all a good day,1
we moved halfway up the country when i wa left my friend and everyone i knew our new house wa in quite a posh well off suburb and the closest school wa full of kid who had grown up together from kindergarten and already had their tight clique the neighborhood resident may have been rich but we were n't we were just renting my gran holiday home not long after my parent broke up and money became even tighter while the other kid had all the rage expensive label gear we had home sewn handmade or 2nd hand pas down so i wa the outsider no one knew who dressed strange i vividly remember knucklebones becoming popular and thinking if i had some people would play with me so i begged my dad for a set of those shiny metal one i got legit real bone cartilage knuckle bone from the butcher that scarrd me to this day the only friend i had were the other outsider the fat kid or the one with disability funny how now my career is in the disability sector which did n't help at all with my desire to be included by the cool kid i also dealt with anxiety and stress and my way of dealing with that wa by developing a habit of constantly pulling out my eyebrow or eyelash when i ran out of them i started on my hair on my head and quickly gained a very large noticeable bald spot intermediate school wa my saviour a all the kid from the primary school in the area attended this one bigger school i made friend some i have to this day i gained confidence and grew out of my weird coping mechanism in high school i flourished my bubbly personality emerged and i became one of the girl boy found attractive my story had a happy ending and in schooling choice i 've made damn sure my daughter doe n't experience what i did,0

it s probably around tenth night in a row where i lie hugging my phone and can t cry although my soul is getting torn apart and it feel like the only way out why is it that the more thought i have ironically the more emptier i feel,1
i dont wan na be awake again it been stuck in my head for quite some time the thought of killing myself but tonight im finally done i dont want to wake up tomorrow i dont want to pretend i can cope with all the trouble and pain life brings anymore im not gon na lie this is a blatant cry for attention i fully intend to end my life tonight and i really just want someone to care it pointless i know but if none of this matter anyways why not call out for some random soul to comfort me a i work up the nerve to jam a knife somewhere important or perhapse just wrap a belt around my neck and let the life leave me no matter what i know it going to hurt but then ill be free i shall not exist to care about the pain and sadness and the crushing loneliness i dont have to worry about the disastrous concequences of my chronic procrastination the depression ruling my life will me gone and me along with it but such seems to be an acceptable sacrifice i 'm sorry to those who will be inconvenienced by my death but i honestly dont give a fuck right now i just want it to end i want it all to go away i 'm not sure if anything could help me at this point ive fucked myself over and im fully aware that it all my fault im only really posting here a a somewhat haphazard and entirely useless attemp at showing i exist proof that at one point i wa a person these file on a server somewhere will almost definitely be forgotten just like all the others here fading away just like me or trying to stop the inevitable decay let be honest no one care i 'm just some nobody with no real prospect society ha told me im broken my thoughs are wrong and evil i am just a monster and this world dosent need more lazy monster ive seen my flaw and know how to fix myself but id rather waste away and end my own life than fix myself i suppose this end my rather long possible nonsensical note feel free to forget about me im not worth the wasted braincells but thank you for reading this it feel good to think ill be remembered atleast for a while even if im not worth it,1
it suck how do you guy cope with it,1
did i try to kill myself i hung myself using my belt and a wardrobe doorknob i lied down there waiting to lose consciousness but after a while i got up because it wa uncomfortable doe that count a a suicide attempt or do i have to wake up to people cry and screaming at me,1
do we cry because it 's a clash of emotion we are feeling i.e sadness cry no sadness happiness cry yes or any of the other many emotion that are opposite we may not recognize the conflicting emotion but it still there,0
i feel weird telling this story because in retrospect i 've realized that i wa definitely pressured hardcore anyway a few year ago a girl i used to work with came over for a nye party admittedly i knew she liked me but i kinda just put it aside the whole night she wa super duper flirty did all this forward stuff like asking for a kiss at midnight etc eventually the party end but she 's still sticking by so i suggest we all go out for food at this point there 's like four or five of u left over she 's getting so clingy at one point that i straight out tell her that i 'm flattered but only think of her a a friend she immediately get defensive and is like are you kidding me right now and essentially tell me i 'm stupid for not liking her then it get very late and i offer to get her a car home she refused over and over and i tell her she can sleep on my couch at this point we 're both drunk and i 'm exhausted so she follows me home and i accept the fact that i wo n't be able to get rid of her until the next day here come the crazy part i go into the bathroom to pee before bed i come back and she 's naked in my bed naked i tell her again i 'm not interested but she just go for it she go down on me and i just give up and go along with it at the time i wa annoyed but looking back now i think about what would 've come of her had she been a man and i a woman i never considered it rape or anything near i wa annoyed but that 's kind of it joke 's on her though i heard she got a uti the next day either way it wa very uncool of her to force herself in my bed,0
my partner of year and i have been having some relationship issue for about the last six month tonight i found out that she doesn t find me sexually desirable anymore and hasn t for more than six month so three of my worst fear have come true and now she s sleeping because she can t keep her eye open anymore and i m cry on the couch i wa unfortunately off my med vyvanse wellbutrin for the last month due to insurance issue and have been taking them since monday no one from my support system is responding which i understand it s after midnight on a work night i didn t know where else to turn i m sorry if this is the wrong place to post,1
i m not gon na put too much effort into this this is a cry for help loneliness ha driven me crazy and i just want to die i don t know what to do,1
i have a big regret in life how can i get over it so the biggest regret in my life that i have n't spent more time with people in my adolescence i am now and i have to go to college and to work other people around me are doing the same a well a a kid i wa very outgoing but around i started to change i spent most of my time with myself it 's hard to explain why now looking back i wish i 'd have spent more time with teen of my age but i did n't there is a year period of social activity pause and that 's a fact now i do n't know for sure but i guess i 'm beating myself up for nothing it 's like sure people say socialization is one of the key to happiness but it seems like a grass is greener on the other side scenario are the people who had a big social circle a teen happier in their 20 than those people who did n't have a big social circle i do n't know i wish to discus this,0
the thing is you don t want to sleep but you don t want to be awake you don t want to eat but you don t want to be hungry you don t want to be around people but you don t want to be alone you don t want to do anything but you don t want to do nothing what you really want is to stop existing but you can t do that without dying and you don t really want to do that either,1
just need to know someone is there i struggle to ask for help at time am going through a bit of a rough time with anxiety and stress right now i m driving myself crazy in my own head just needing to know someone is out there just needing some virtual company and some distraction how do you keep it all together,0

xanax shouldn t be promoted at all imo it s a terrible drug and is often fake when you buy it black market and can be fatal like in lil peep s case his xans were laced with fentanyl i also feel like that add to the stigma that psychedelics are gateway drug if you take lsd you should see the trip through if you think you need xanax to pull out of it you shouldn t be doing it in the first place edit also i ve seen a lot of red xanax in rotation lately if you re going to take it don t take the red one those are all fake and are far more potent than real xanax,0

just venting hey all i dunno how to start this rant/stream of consciousness off but i 've been felt completely empty a of late well i 've felt depressed for year but i feel like i 've been in this terrible depressing state for a month now i would 've thought it 'd last a few day but no i 'm still in it i do n't enjoy anything anymore or not a much a i used to by a far margin so every morning just feel wasted i do n't think there ha been a morning where i did n't think of dying or how painful this day will continue to be and that i should just close my eye and think i 'm somewhere else i 'm mediocre at everything and seemed to have a haze over my eye regarding how good at thing i actually wa i 'm in my final year of high school education and i realize how important it is but i 'm not doing anything i seem 'satisfied with just seeing my life wither away apart from those time where it all come to me and i cry in the dark i have no purpose and do n't know what i want to do i 'd like to have a purpose in the world i do n't want to be an aimless person wandering around this world that will be forgotten but i 'm certainly not doing anything to change that i opened my math book open a few day ago and simply could n't think nothing came to my head i did n't know what to do my writing seemed alien and the mind fog wa real late last year i said to myself that i 'd change myself it wa an on and off routine and it 's barely evident in my life anymore i thought having the stride to change myself would well guarantee some progress but i 've come to realize that these thoughts/hope materialized because i 'm getting older and realize i need to be something in life the school break start tomorrow and i have n't thought of it at all i 've been thinking of nothing i used to dream about what i 'd do in the school holiday but it ha n't occurred to me at all i do n't care about anything and it wo n't get better i do n't trust the statement 'it get better because that 's dependent on me i 'm not a great person and isolate people and while i could work on myself i 'm still surrounded by toxicity myself it wo n't get better but i just wanted a place to vent because i 've got nobody else to talk to and when i did i realized that some people do n't care for emotional talk unless it 's about their own strife in life i do n't think i 'll kill myself this year or the next regardless of my success but i think it 's inevitable i do n't think so many year of sadness and depressing feeling fly away just like that regardless of what you do i feel like it 's stuck with me forever if you gave me the option to kill myself with no pain done to any party i 'd accept i really would maybe i 'd struggle with my word but whatever,1

and people think i 'm the nice guy of the group or the smart guy because he 's introverted and wear glass play video game and say strange thing dude it 's not because i smile at you and hate cussing or break fight that i am anything close to your role model.why do older people always assume what i look like is what i 'm like.im just like this because i do n't want you to be my enemy.i am manipulating you so that you see what i want you to see.im atually extremely judgmental and selfish selective of who i interact with and very very narcissistic.i do n't eat food if it look bad.im not friend with ugly people.i smile and greet good morning to everyone when actually it 's just mechanic and i do n't want them to be my enemy.but truth is i 'm so scared.im lonely and scared and i need a hug but at the same time i push everyone back and hit them with all i got.besides you know me then you probably wo n't want to give me a hug.because i just want everyone to disappear.you do n't want to be my friend.but i actually wish i wa someone else.i misunderstand every interaction in my social time i 'm a blind man with a cloth behind his eye and i always offend stranger or act like they 're trying to murder me.it just flow out of me when i see strange people knocking at my door and i do n't know why i always prepare to take them down lol they 're probably there because they need something anyway life is a game of trade.theyre there to use me a they see fit so they will need to adjust accordingly to my want i hate children.i hate kids.one look at a kid sends me into a deep philosophical debate filled with angst hate and pity.its because they remind me of myself.i take a look at them and see all their doubt and dream what they 're going to go through and think it 's best for everyone if they disappeared.i see myself at that age living inside a fantasy world.thinking i would be someone important so now i 'll talk about my other side.i actually connect very strongly with people i like i instantly admire and worship them.i ca n't say no to them and there 's always the necessity to appease them and stroke their little egos.its either huh who 's that or o god praise be to thee and i hate this.i ca n't learn to be social it 's impossible for me because im so out of touch with my feeling and i ca n't feel others feeling towards me.on sunday before bed i feel like a beaten horse and then after waking up there 's that energy urging me to do what i always wanted to to make big plan for the day and i hate this.at this time i feel most vulnerable.i wish this would end soon,1

tonight 's the night so i 've just worked out how to send a delayed message off my phone which mean i can text a friend that i 've done the deed do the deed and they can panic and call emergency service after i 'm long gone no risk of me being saved no need for my roommate to find a bloody corpse and hopefully no what if i 'd called the ambulance a minute faster -guilt for my friend win win win it wa the last barrier to my suicide and now it 's gone i actually feel so relieved i 'm not too sure why i 'm posting this it 's not that i want anyone to talk me out of it i 've been working up the ball to do this for year and if anything i need someone to encourage me to take that final step but i doubt i 'll find that here so moving on i guess i just want to let it out before i go i feel like there 's gon na be a lot of shit made up after i go and even if you 're the only one who read it i want someone to know the truth see i 'm and i 'm a law student in one of the better program in my country and when i go there 's going to be a whole thing about creating a better culture for student and student mental health if they do n't just ignore it altogether which i 'd honestly prefer the thing is i do n't have any worry about the uni side of thing i find the course challenging but interesting and honestly it 's about the only thing going right for me the reason i 'm going to kill myself is because i 'm short fat relatively stupid lonely a hell and fuck ugly not a lot to it i have a fair few friend but there 's maybe two that i 'd feel alright telling this to one of them told me she needed to focus on her own mental health and could n't deal with being my support completely fair no hard feeling and the other is going to get that text i talked about up top this is n't some rushed decision on my part i 've been depressed since i wa maybe earlier but that 's when i remember first fantasising about dying when i wa i realised that i could actually go ahead and kill myself which wa honestly a pretty freeing revelation for the last five year i 've been doing my best to work up the gut to end it all and now here we are i feel like i 've given life a fair go i 've moved out moved to a different city even travelled a tiny bit what 's become clear to me doing all of that is that it 's not a problem with my situation it 's not something that 's going to get better a i go through life the problem a i see it is that i 'm a defective human i have absolutely no desire to go through another year feeling alone and disconnected and miserable and ending thing tonight is just convenient and easy and practical that 's basically it if any of my friend somehow find this and link it back to me there 's no hard feeling there 's no one big bad event that led to this this is just the smart choice for me if any of you bothered reading this thanks for the time hope you guy have a better life than i did,1

i have been feeling like this for a while now ever since the new semester of school started i feel like i have been struggling more often than i used to i feel so stupid compared to my friend and peer i specifically remember one moment when i wa working with a friend on our programming assignment i remember him being so enthusiastic discussing on writing code to solve a problem i do n't remember saying a word because i had no idea what he wa talking about and i felt bad because i did not contribute to the conversation for me it is difficult to work on my homework because i always feel 'tired and i ca n't join event or club because i am too 'busy i want to succeed in my study but i feel like i belong somewhere else because i am too 'stupid and 'slow i do n't know if i am giving up too easily because i also have to stay on track to pay off loan and keep my family happy i know that i have potential to succeed because i got here for a reason i recently started to try to make better habit such a waking up early and exercising if i have any time getting a better diet is difficult because i have a bad habit of eating out and i feel cooking at home take too much time i wa curious if antidepressant could work but i did not do my research i just want to have that feeling of optimism again when i would come home from a busy day making a lot of progress on work and feeling good about it i am currently not doing well in my class and i hope to bounce back on top until school end,1
i am sorry i ca n't take this anymore for the past year i have been struggling with depression anxiety and constant suicidal thought but today thing became so much worse my overall problem is that i just feel so utterly worthless and pointless i can not describe how much i hate myself i know for a fact that i am never going to achieve anything in life whatsoever i am an unlikable person and because of that i do n't have friend nobody like me and for a good reason i am so annoying and negative sadly i ca n't seem to find a way to fix myself and that is why i certainly wo n't achieve anything in a social aspect but that is not where it end i have no chance of success in term of career aswell i am so stupid i have no talent when i wa younger people used to tell me that i am good at math and physic and naturally i started believing them i thought my life 's purpose wa to become a scientist one day i wa so naive year ago i realized that they all lied to me i wa never even mediocre in that field yeah i won prize on a few competition but for me that wa sheer luck i have never deserved them the situation became a lot worse today i am on a competition again feeling like shit because i know that i failed once again my stupidity started becoming apparent i feel worse than i ever have i have n't eaten anything today i am basically living on self-hate right now i ca n't get out of the bed in the hotel room the good thing is that my room is on the 16th floor maybe i will finally get the courage to finally jump and end all of my pain i have everything prepared what make thing worse is that i have told all these thing to a girl that wa concerned because my depression became more visible recently and is on the same competition and she know that i failed but she doe n't seem to care at all she wa telling me about how much she cared and how everybody would miss me if i were to kill myself but now it seems like she doe n't care at all i completely understand her but it still break my heart and it hurt so much i am sorry that this post turned out to be such a mess i just needed to vent because all these thought have been killing me from the inside,1
anyone else go through day where you 're like okay wow life is actually nice and think you 're finally gon na get better only to switch right back a few day or hour later it 's honestly exhausting seeing the nice part of life because you know they are n't gon na last one of the main reason i 've never gotten too far into thinking about killing myself is because i 'm so curious about life and the possibility of one day feeling content but i 'm really worried that i 'll lose that hope and give in any advice on how to find good part of life to hold onto,1

help me please i 'm a year old man from the netherlands who is turning in a few day i 've been dealing with depression for about or year now when i wa a teen my mother did not know how to deal with me because i used to be very hotheaded and hyperactive which led to her and me having daily argument my father wa almost always working so he wa n't often there for me and if he wa home he did n't want anything to do with his kid my sister is a person i have trouble being around she berates me for a whole lot of thing i have very little control over i 'll state why later when my parent divorced i quickly started to blame myself over it because i always fought with my mother and felt that i ruined their marriage i wa quickly starting to fail my last year in elementary school and ended up scoring way lower than the teacher expected me to score middle school wa even worse a i quickly before the person to bully by my class and by a few others which only helped to destroy my already damaged self-esteem and self-worth by the time i wa in middle school my mother had a new husband who wa a very abusive person both verbally and physically he is now out of my life luckily but he gave my mother permanent hand damage he gave my sister a scar on her leg and he damaged my shoulder and upper back whenever i wa n't fighting with my mother or step-father they were fighting with each other i had to go to my father 's every two weekend and half the time during holiday the first few time went well where i actually spend time with him but that all spiraled down once my step-mother came into the picture i started to shut myself in because she wa someone i had never seen before and i could n't trust new people easily already my depression gradually and steadily worsened around that time too and none of my parental figure knew what to do with me my mother and step-father argued with me all the time while my father and step-mother did n't bother to ask me if i wanted to do anything and let me just stay in bed all day long i even stopped joining them for dinner at one point when i turned i wa taken out of my home situation and i wa put in a clinic so i could learn how to fend for myself because no one had tried to teach me and i had literally no skill to do anything while i wa at the clinic i took a brain scan which revealed something about myself that worsened my self-worth even further there wa something wrong with my brain for whatever reason my brain is always overactive and take up a whole lot of my energy kind of like a burn-out over my whole life i got berated by literally almost everyone a lazy when it wa actually a medical issue fast forward some time and i wa in court a a year old because i originally wanted to remove any form of parental right over my father because he did n't bother to do anything for me because he did n't know what he could do but the judge ultimately ruled for the opposite after asking me which wa that he wa forced to seek contact with me around that time i learned that i am bisexual with a heavy preference for men which i confided in my mother with her promising to not tell anyone i quickly learned that that wa the wrong choice a not even after a week everyone on my mother 's side of the family knew about it my sister literally wanted to cut off all contact with me for being lgbt which she only did n't because her boyfriend told her to stop being so stupid this resulted in spiraling even further down into my self-loathing and completely destroying my self-confidence and self-worth and i wa put on antidepressant however i wa quickly taken off of them after telling them i started to see mental image of very gory self-mutilation when i turned i wa discharged from the clinic and now i live supervised in a home with other people my father had stopped contacting me completely the moment i turned and by then my mother divorced her second husband fast forward uneventful year of me trying desperately to get out of bed in the morning my grandmother on my father 's side died which resulted in me and my sister both regaining contact with our father the contact between him and me is alright now and i 've stayed at his home for new year a few month back the relationship with my mother is now okay again and we do n't fight a much anymore however that 's pretty much all the good news that ha happened my sister and i still barely have any contact my mother and i barely have any contact and even though my father and i are on good term again the contact is sparse financially i 'm having trouble almost every month a because of my brain problem i 'm unable to work and i 'm not eligible for a disability check because i have worked in the past so i should be able to hold a job and now that i 'm turning in a few day my alimony ha stopped a well i 'm having more trouble than ever to try to get out of bed and go to bed at a reasonable time i wa put on a different brand of antidepressant but i could n't bother taking them anymore because they simply did n't do anything i have one person on this world that i am able to really trust and he life on the different side of the earth i just do n't know what to do anymore i 'm unable to allow people close to me and when they do i mask my feeling without even thinking about it i do n't feel like i have a purpose to be alive on this world i do n't know if people say they care about me if they really mean it i feel alone abandoned with no hope left people tell me to look for a hobby to occupy yourself with but even that 's out of reach for me when i get tired after doing grocery at a store minute away from my home i 've ended my time with my psychologist because eventually she started berating me and telling me you need to start finding something to do during the day and you need to start working on a sleep schedule a if i do n't understand that and the professional therapist i would 've gotten literally said the following work to me you can not be depressed because you said it with a smile i think that i have no purpose on this earth and i 'm beyond help i 've been tethering on the edge of ending it and be done with it for everyone 's sake or cling to the almost fake hope that someone will find me pick me up and help me through my problem,1

i hate debating with other people on complex topic screw debating on the internet and in real life topic have so many side to them and there are so many conflicting statistic that say different thing that after a while of thinking i never know what stance i want to take on it yet so many people find it so easy to do so and have such an irritating sense of self-righteousness about their opinion at that not only that but a lot of people me included if it 's something i have a strong opinion on will get bloody defensive and angry if their obviously correct opinion is challenged and both side will say such incendiary rage-inducing stuff to each other and yet expect the other side to simply accept what they are saying without acknowledging that both side have their point it 's almost impossible to think objectively and logically when this is happening eventually the debate becomes more than a simple disagreement and becomes personal where both side just want to win in order to demonstrate superiority over the other person most of the time whoever win is only the person who 's the best at arguing and deflecting their opponent 's argument it ha le to do with who 's actually right and more to do with the skill of the person making the argument so fuck debating it 's terrible,0

if something upset you bother you hurt you make you uncomfortable then it matter just because so-and-so ha problem that seem worse than yours it doesn t make your issue invalid it kill me when someone open up and talk about what going wrong in their life and the person they re talking to say well at least it isn t any worse that make me feel so little and like an annoying complainer because obviously my life isn t actually that bad,1

i go to one of the largest university in the nation and am having a really tough time here while trying to not let depression take over my life yesterday i wa killing time in between class a usual sitting near some tree in a popular part of campus to study at on a scale from my depression wa at an or and i desperately needed help i posted on yik yak asking if anyone near me wanted to give me a hug yik yak is a popular app among college student kind of like an anonymous twitter and you can only see post within a mile away from you or something like that i ended up deleting the post almost instantly because i felt silly asking for a stranger to give me a hug but within a minute a random girl peeked at my phone asked if i wa the one who posted the anonymous cry for help and hugged me while i choked back tear i still ca n't believe it happened i did n't catch her name or say much to her but it really helped me get through the day,1
why do people get so melodramatic on these post it 's not the poster it 's the commenters a lot of you are so helpful and i 'm grateful but there are also a lot among you who comment nonsensical irrelevant and frankly melodramatic comment it 's this pseudo-helpful stuff that probably came from a good place but just end up clogging the comment section with rubbish breathe just breathe live keep on breathing deep breath come on take a night 's rest and you will see the light i promise stuff like that it 's usually about breathing or living anyway usually in the form of a saying or figure of speech like suicidal people would suddenly just forget to breathe or suddenly our heart just stop and all we can say is oh well guess i forgot how to keep the ol popper ticking people did remind me to keep living after all silly me a i said these comment probably came from a very good place i just want to reinforce the fact that the story of suicidal people are not emotional attraction for people to ride we just want help validation and support we 're not here for reminder that someone out there will love u or reminder to breathe maybe it 's just me perhaps i 've gotten more bitter after year of feeling this way i personally just do n't find comment like that helpful to me it make you look like you 're there to leech off of other people 's misery so you can feel better about yourself while still submitting low-effort helpful comment so you can make yourself believe that you did something good if anything it make me want to do it more to those that ca n't relate to this those that know they genuinely care and always make sure their comment are heartfelt and lengthy you are a great person and this is definitely not directed at you i just wish people would stop giving that light at the end of the tunnel bullshit while completely overlooking and gleefully ignoring the gigantic hurdle that someone just talked about positive thinking only get someone so far thanks for reading,1

really considering suiciding over my lack of social connection feeling alone and helpless i 'm never had a true relationship never had sex unemployed even if i have a degree lived pretty much in isolation from to now only had friend i do n't even go out with anymore the worst thing is not even my situation it 's the fact that i do n't know how to get out of it i go out and see couple people socializing and having friend meeting people while i ca n't figure out where to make friend since i have no hobby or even a job the only thing keeping me alive is the hope to change this situation i keep myself groomed i diet and lift and i 'm above average looking but what 's the point when i do n't go out or i do n't know where to meet people especially in the winter where am i supposed to find a partner i 'm going out only maybe time a month right now what 's the point of going out when i ca n't connect with people and form friendship just today i went out in a public place full of young people and now i feel even worse seeing what i could have but i do n't made me want to kill myself once and for all i feel old alone and done i feel i lost my best year never experienced happiness and rejected by life i feel so close to getting finally happiness but yet so far i do n't ask much i just want a partner i like and a social life i feel stupid for wanting to kill myself over something that appears so easy to get for most of the people but incredibly hard to get for me,1

body image is simply the bitch of all bitch i know i 've lost a significant amount of weight in the last few year but i have a hard time internalizing it i know i 'm lb lighter because the scale told me but to my eye my body is just one massive imperfection i 'm a dancer so my body is on display all the time and i 'm always receiving compliment about my weight loss and it 's nice for my hard work to be recognized it 's been three year of slow but steady progress but i still ca n't internalize it i 've spent too many year hating myself and falling asleep praying that i 'll wake up a completely different person the last three year i 've stayed in the gym and counted macro developed a way better relationship with food and found the support of my best friend who struggled with similar issue basically i changed my mind and my attitude and my body followed all these thing combined and i 'm in the best shape of my life i love seeing my muscle and having big biceps and quad love finally feeling comfortable at work and on the beach but i still ca n't see it last night my coworker gave me the nicest compliment about my current muscle tone and i kind of shrugged it off she looked me in the face and wa like can you really not see it she actually looked concerned i have no picture to compare myself to because i literally never took photo of myself maybe one shot of my face every six month and never anything with my body i still have zero photo of myself even at my current weight because i 'm petrified of being on camera give me anxiety to the point of actually getting angry with the person trying to take the photo wtf is that about hahaha my mom ha always called herself fat and ugly and whenever i 've called her beautiful she answer every single time with no i 'm fat there 's no convincing her otherwise it 's incredibly sad and heartbreaking to know she hate her look she also refuse to be in photo and i think i get my camera shyness from her she 's never ever called me fat or put my body down but she ha said many time you get your body type from me im so sorry and her and my grandma have never hid the fact that they pride thinness in my family and conflate thinness with beauty basically i wa raised with a fucking extremely negative body image that 's carried into my adult life i 'd call myself fat and my mom would be like no you 're thin you 're thin a can be i knew it wa n't true and i wish she would have just said yeah maybe but you 're still beautiful instead of lying and telling me i wa thin when i knew i wa n't now i feel like everyone who compliment my body is lying to patronize me fucked up and crazy complicated i know hahahaha regardless of how i wa raised now that i 'm an adult it 's my responsibility to heal myself and create a better body image for myself and love myself unconditionally and to be sure i never pas those mode of thinking on to any potential child i have or kids/teens in my life but it 's so hard when my eye and brain are showing me something different in the mirror,0

lonely and running out of hope i 've been depressed for several year now and suicidal ideation is n't new for me recently though it 's moved past ideation into thought that have the same theme you are n't making it through this and the few people who do care about you are going to be relieved if you just shut up and end it over and over i tell myself my life is no longer worth living i have a chronic illness that is painful and will most likely end in my death not quickly or swiftly but agonizing pain that slowly end in my loss of independent function entirely because of the nature of this because of practical matter of day to day life all of my friendship are a pale imitation of what they once were my family try to help but they lose patience quickly now and have life of their own i did try talking to one of my parent about my mental state and clearly said i wa thinking of killing myself any response that would 've helped i love you please do n't think that way how can we help let 's get you some help asap we care you 'd be sorely missed talk to me remained unsaid probably because they are n't true any of those thing would 've helped a fucking hug would 've helped anything indicating empathy sympathy love caring concern anything would 've helped the response i did get wa so ludicrous that it deepened my dismal hopelessness i do n't know what to do anymore i really do n't part of me doe n't want to die but it 's an increasingly small part the life i have what 's it worth endless pain and suffering with no one to confide in not much not much of anything,1
about a year ago i realized my computer wa running slower than usual-of course this took me a few week to realize since the decrease in performance wa gradual once i realized i opened the process tab and find this program depression.exe running hogging a lot of my cpu i 'm fairly sure it 's a virus but the weirdest thing is that i haven t been downloading anything that would contain a virus… and a far a i can tell it doe n't even have a function it only purpose is to hog cpu and make it more difficult to perform basic function so anyway i try closing it but nothing happens i try again until window give me the typical depression.exe is not responding obviously i click close now and wait a bit but still nothing happens i keep clicking everywhere and mashing button to end the program psa this is an awful idea… trying to do too much will only overload your computer but my desktop only freeze oh well i say i ll just restart the computer and hope that tomorrow i ll have more success in getting rid of the virus the next week or so i keep mashing button and hitting end now but again this only overload my computer and force me to shut down for the day meanwhile the virus ha been getting greedier and is taking up more and more of my cpu program run slower and i experience more stutter and lag in processing eventually i gave up trying to end depression.exe by conventional mean and sought antivirus software the software wa a bit of a pain to install at first and costed a chunk of change and unfortunately did no good sure it wa able to detect the virus it turn out that it s not so uncommon but wa useless in actually removing it i had the same experience with other antivirus software not powerful enough didn t detect the problem misidentified the virus… the list go on i still try to run antivirus software once a week just in case but most of the time it just us up even more cpu some other user try to help but it s obvious they never had this malware have you tried turning it on and off again sometimes when my computer is overloaded i just need to delete a lot of process for a bit or it ll run quickly again you ll see they don t understand just how terrible depression.exe is it s difficult because i rely on this computer for school work you name it when i first had the virus it wasn t too difficult to still carry out my responsibility but since the virus ha grown it s become much more difficult some day the computer won t even boot up i miss assignment and fall behind all because of this awful virus i see others whose computer run just fine and wonder what i did to get this virus and how my computer is just so different compared to theirs when we have the same model some day i just want to scrap my computer even though i can t afford a new one edit thanks so much for the positive response guy i 've enjoyed reading all your response and hope you get a hug for every bad day you 've had,1
should i move where to hello everyone i 've lived in cold weather climate all of my life chicago minneapolis and a i get older about to turn winter get really old on me fast a i am typing this it 's now snowing out here in minneapolis in april the thing is minneapolis is a pretty decent city and i have a good well-paying job but i hate the extreme temperature the absolutely frigid winter and basically anything over 80f 27c during the summer if there is humidity involved and there generally is anyone have any recommendation of a reasonable climate which doe n't get too hot or cold and ha good tech job yes i 'd love anything in the bay area portland or seattle but the price that go with that would make anything super expensive i 'd love not to have to drive to work a well but i can probably only be so picky there is ironically some subreddits /r/whereshouldimove and /r/whereshouldibe but they are basically inactive hoping for some lively conversation from people who know city in the u i 'd love to move internationally but the logistics behind that would be tough,0
confused about grad school and life in general today i got accepted into a very prestigious american university for a graduate healthcare degree i didn t think i wa going to get in but i actually got accepted with a scholarship even with the scholarship though it s very expensive my wife and i are very economically conservative despite having high paying job in our mid 20 that being said we can pay entirely for the degree it s part time so i don t have to quit my job using my take home salary alone over the next two year while still paying all of our bill and putting money into a saving account no loan required i applied to this program because i wanted my career to have a chance at being meaningful i m young but working in healthcare technology is a very tangible way that i can see myself putting my skill to good use for the benefit of everyone i currently work in an industry that i do not find meaningful/worthwhile it pay the bill but at the end of the day i m really only serving myself by earning a paycheck my work doe not make anyone s life better except maybe our shareholder i m afraid if i stay in this line of work i will wake up and comfortable year will have gone by and i ll have made zero contribution to society however my wife think the degree is too expensive i ve analyzed our financial situation a hundred different way and barring any unforeseen drastic change in our job status or lifestyle knock on wood you never know we can afford this degree our saving account won t be skyrocketing during it but we can afford it with no loan we both attended a school for undergrad on a significant scholarship and worked all through college so we have zero debt at the moment i know it s expensive but i ve been thinking about it a lot that if i were to get accepted what would i do i believe that those who are able to help out humanity in whatever way should do their part i believe we have been very blessed to have no student debt good job and for me to have gotten accepted into a grad program i never thought i could get into i believe we are able to do this and that i can make a difference in someone s life somewhere by pursuing this degree i think that make it worth it am i crazy for thinking this at the end of my career i want to have made an impact to have helped others i want to leave the world a better place when i die than it wa when i wa born there are so many pain point in the american healthcare system this is an industry that need innovation and i want to be a part of that effort am i being too idealistic here maybe too proud am i thinking i m noble and heroic for wanting to do this or do you think my heart is in the right place i would really love to hear anyone s thought i really need some insight here i have to make my decision very soon and please be a painfully honest a you can you will not hurt my feeling even if you tell me i m an idiot i promise,0

today feel like my day i have the whole day to figure it out so i 'm and when i wa i decided to eat ibuprofen the thing is that it 's anti inflammatory and wont destroy my organ so after and a half hour i called somebody confused a to why it wa n't working so had it been paracetamol i probably would n't be writing this eventually a friend found me in the back of an industrial estate and took me to a hospital they gave me fluid and locked me up etc this wa because a few hour before the cute 20yr filipino business student i wa dating at the time sent me a picture of her creampie with another man whilst i wa high on lsa we 'd been still sleeping together but separated a she wa into ddlg and i wa n't but i still loved her we actually kept that going for a few more year by the time that ended i wa very ready to make the final leap but i quit all drug and alcohol and managed to stare at the tv for month i would pretend in my mind i wa the character in long running tv show in a strange attempt to forget who and where i wa every thursday or friday i would boot up a clone of her o and watch her cheat on her new boyfriend on facebook i could only do it for minute at a time if i had a really positive week and i wa feeling good it wa therapeutic somehow when i wa i finally asked a woman to be my room mate because she wa drug free and i 'd know her since high school we both fell into a relationship unintentionally she wa a successful pharmacist with a degree i got very attached having tried to take my own life before i had a certain clarity of mind this made me sharp apathetic but also more militant in the way i would do thing in life it quickly became apparent that my new partner wa an alcoholic and sometimes abusive i wa confronted with situation where she wa disappointed in my ambition and achievement in life i wa and still unemployed with aspergers an addiction to moba and in poor health the routine became that i would never change a a vehicle for any argument having pretty severe short term memory loss this would compound into way i would never imagine subtle thing like making her tea or buying her flower would actually annoy her eventually my presence would begin to annoy her having failed to seek mental health and giving me a number of opportunity to turn my life around she finally cracked last night the immediate issue is we 've barely been apart in a year and a half perhaps le than a week and i am completely dependent on her psychologically from the ash of my extreme relationship i poured almost all i had left into an even more extreme one in a very unhealthy way but this wa n't evident to her and i 've just kept the pace now i 'm left with a gripping sense of purpose to take my own life i do n't have any sorrow or malice in my heart when she tell me it going to be okay and comfort me i can only go along with it and lie to her whilst i look over her shoulder and roof fixture capable of holding my weight or how sharp the kitchen knife are for self harm finally i revealed to her my only thought and she becomes angry telling me that i am trying to leverage her like a teenager would my thought are how painful the experience would be generally i 've thought about a noose a thats what my friend did recently i had already planned to go to the hardware store today and get rope but then i have reservation because i would be hurting her emotion catastrophically from my death and a an alcoholic i doubt she could easily overcome the grief what is most harrowing to me is the silence eventually if i moved all my belonging and into another house and i wa confronted with an lone bedroom without her snoring or stealing the bedding from me the absense of her after so long would be crushing add to the fact that i am much older and have experienced that crushing pain again and again this time it really feel like it would have a permanence wanting to grab a kitchen knife and mutilate myself while shes in the next room sipping a coffee is an urge i have to fight with all that i have i hyperventilate and pull out my hair she is suggesting i can sort my life out and win her back which is what is troubling me this would be all the easier to process if she simply did n't love me anymore but she is suggesting if i do enough to impress her and change my life it could very well be fixed whilst i simultaneously caught her trying to setup coffee with her ex last week today she left for work at 5am i am home alone to process this and my dream last night were all about suicide it is now 7am i have a bottle of paracetamol a quater rum and a piss poor kitchen knife and i have train of thought firstly drink and mutilate myself and see how far i can take it secondly buy a large amount of water bottle and sleep in the street in an alley deep in the city and shit in public toilet and see how long i can starve and lastly go to the hardware store and make a noose the choice are hard because dying outright would do catastrophic thing to my partner but i am in a dark place i am really conflicted i would really like to support or even believe a narrative in which it will all be okay or that i 'm just some kind of emotional blackmailing person just hell bent on keeping my relationship but those kind of assessment of my feeling seem shallow and dismissive and when i try and discus how i feel i am often left with get help it not my problem this eventually lends to the idea that i truly am master of my emotion and that unfortunately my feeling have merit and i should just get on with it,1

the brain i 've been mentally and physically abused from a very young age until i wa although it still felt like quite a normal life when my dad left and i wa just being raised by my mom it wa the best time of my life a sad a it is from until wa the only time i ever had friend actual genuine friend who i had fun with and considered family during this time though wa when one of the contributor to my fucked up brain wa coming to fruition my brother introduced me to porn when i wa very young he taught me how to masturbate and that evolved into me and him masturbating under his sheet together then one day he proposed the idea that we jack each other off while we were taking a bath forgot to mention he is year older than me this caused me to have a fucked up psychological state for a long time i thought i wa gay for a long time even though i knew a hundred percent i wa attracted to woman i have fucked up sexual desire due to this i 'm attracted to my fucking cousin i 'm not gon na go into more depth about this because it 's too painful being self aware of the fucked up thought i have anyways we moved to jakarta when i wa in grade that 's when my social life ended all my trauma came back and i just could n't socialize it wa terrifying and i ended up becoming addicted to my computer i had no friend for year and only superficial relationship with other loser in my freshman year i took some action and went out to party went out a few time drinking until i met some other people that were pretty cool i still kept up a fake persona so i could not connect with anyone drank at least once a week then i moved to kyiv in grade my first school i went to wa terrible all my fault because i ruined it for myself i closed myself in with defensive wall and wa an unintentional asshole causing everyone to hate me i dropped out to do online course suddenly by just not showing up to school one day my mom allowed me to do that because she noticed the dire situation i wa in the online course turned into me spending a whole year in one room without leaving almost ever i played game and watched movie and youtube video i coped with my shitty life by drowning in dopamine giving tool on my laptop my mom went crazy throughout the year because i wa failing the online course and wa just fucking around in this year i met one guy i 'll call him owen me and owen were n't really friend just two loser who got together because we were rejected by all others me and him smoked a lot of weed together i do n't know why i smoked weed because every time i did i became extremely anxious and closed off he witnessed my mental decline first hand he definitely noticed i wa not okay we also discovered hard drug that year we met some guy that became our drug dealer one night when we were searching for a strip club one thing led to another and we met some ukrainian pimp who also deal drug the first time i asked him if he had ecstasy he said yea and when we actually got it it wa some paper with a mound of white powder we did n't know it wa speed at the time we had absolutely no idea what we were taking we did n't snort it we ate the speed the night started out we felt the effect about minute in it wa crazy too fucking crazy i started talking non stop i think i wa repeating the word fuckin all throughout the night the most terrifying thing wa that we both blacked out for a majority of the night and my mom wa about meter away in her room he stopped talking all night he became a mute i wa terrified i thought he had lost his mind so i panicked and wa trying to get him to say something literally anything it wa a clusterfuck we could have easily od 'd that night the fucking drug dealer wa trying to get u hooked so we would be recurring customer i black out and then i hear my mom voice at 8am in the morning a soon a i hear her voice i snap out of the trance still fucked i had to go to the store with her and her friend we went and a we were going i wa trying to keep my cool although still tripping hard anyways i did it just fine my friend stayed at my place and said he saw ghost i did this stuff a few more time it got to the point where i starting picking through the carpet looking for anything that ever resembles speed to get another hit i stopped myself before it got too bad then we discovered ecstasy oooooh man is ecstasy wonderful it is honestly one of the highlight of my life still gon na do it again sometime soon when we started out we did it too often like once or twice a week i 'd be trying to trick my mom into giving me my allowance by changing the progress bar on the website of my online school it worked a few time after bingeing a lot we decided to take it easy we did some research on how to roll safely and tried i still pop molly to this day but a lot le frequently the molly wa also pretty bad it contributed to my intense depression after a year of absolute hell i wa ready after only socializing with owen and my mom for a year i wanted to be better this time i wa gon na be outgoing and have lot of friend i started school again at the other international school my first day wa cringe but far better because i wa optimistic to give you an idea i introduced myself to a group of guy in my grade nearly my whole grade and when they asked where i wa from i said i 'm white i met some other guy that were pretty cool though now we 're at the part of the story where i am living now i 've made a decent amount of friend still do n't consider them close friend more like school friend i 've blocked myself off with my defensive wall again and this time people do n't hate me they are just weirded out by me still though i 'm proud of what i 've achieved i get invited to party and what not i still feel empty though i feel like i want to improve myself but i do n't have the energy to do so even if i wanted to i would be working at a lost cause because i feel that due to my experience my brain is deteriorating and i am incapable of being who i want to be i 'll never become someone i 'll be proud of i 'll never be proud of myself and above all i am literally unable to have a human connection i 've lost touch with family even the mom i live with i do not connect with her i 've lost of my social skill i am beyond salvageable i feel like all of that can be fixed by just erasing myself from this world death is natural i do not belong and that 's fine with me my existence will only cause more problem in the future for my family and for those around me my child will have my dna which will leave them handicapped we are all part of the game of life natural selection is selecting against me i guess i am just not meant to be i am going to kill myself but i am letting this come to the grave with me i just needed to tell someone just needed to get it off my chest so at least one person could see this i feel like an asshole for killing myself because i know it will cause immense pain for my mom and my brother which i do not hold any grudge against despite what he did he wa young stupid and also traumatised i hope they will understand and if not i will explain when we meet again where this fucked up life of mine is out of the picture,1

i 'll never forget this man i never met a few day ago my girlfriend wa on her way to the hospital to say goodbye to the woman who raised her it 'd been a highly emotional couple of day since the decision wa to remove critical life support and let her pas on so i can only imagine how exhausted my girlfriend wa after spending all of the previous day and most of the evening by her mother 's bedside and then going into work the very next day she 's very strong and hide it well but i know she wa hurting when she left work in the early afternoon on the way to the hospital she stopped by to get a sandwich for lunch being the sweetheart she is she called me up at school to take my order a well i remember being very happy to hear she wa getting food it 's so easy to forget to eat when you 're sick to your stomach with grief unfortunately after placing her order her payment would n't go through and she wa resigned to leaving empty handed but sitting down eating his lunch wa an observant bus driver i do n't know if he paid for the meal because he could see how upset she wa or if it wa just another good deed he performed throughout the day either way it doe n't really matter why he did because whether he know it or not the compassion he showed came during one of the hardest day of her life i will forever be grateful to this person who stepped up and cared for my girlfriend during the darkest day he wa a source of light a reminder of the love and humanity she received from her mother le than two hour after this act of kindness her mother passed peacefully with with my girlfriend by her side it 's been a long and hard weekend and she is still grieving but a the memory of her mother will live on forever with her so too will the action of this man who saw a fellow human being in need i doubt he will ever realize how much his action meant that day but i know i will never forget this man i never met,0

exam are making it worse my gcse are in a month and i 've done no revision i try but i genuinely ca n't find the motivation within me to put pen to paper i 'm so terrified of failing my exam but i 've got no motivation to study for them i 'm really struggling to push out the thought that killing myself is the answer to this sitatuion i know how stupid it sound to feel that way over exam but i ca n't deal with the thought of underachieving to this extent if i do n't even have the motivation to revise even when i care about failing how will i function in a real world situation that i do n't care about that much,1

there is actually a lot of misinformation out there about lsd and drug in general especially on reddit i have done every drug you have probably ever heard of and then some fun other little research chemical not all experience were positive but none were net negative the first thing you need to know about lsd is the safety info if possible get your lsd tested after you buy to ensure it 's real and/or the right chemical if you ca n't try tasting the tab for a little bit if it taste like anything at all other than paper and ink it is likely not lsd but some research chemical derivative most of them are actually cool drug if done properly but they are usually dosed too high because people trying to rip others off are n't usually the brightest bunch a for the actual trip this is where what you may have read is going to differentiate from what you experience lsd is a hallucinogenic drug but it is a milder one so there will not be any kind of open eyed visuals other than some waving and color manipulation you are not going to hallucinate for example another person being there or thing being physically moved ever unless you close your eye and concentrate the magic of lsd is being able to be more creative with your mind in a way the actual high is a little bit of a light feeling in your head and a bit of the short term memory loss type buzz like weed you might have a tendency to overthink thing and get in loop have distraction around so you can break out of them more easily if it becomes a problem the only thing you need to do to have a positive drug experience no matter the drug is to dose correctly and have a positive mindset after being dosed i have never seen anything go wrong when people follow those rule on drug if you 're worried either just do n't do lsd or start with a small dose to increase your confidence how you react to lsd is a good indicator of how far you might be comfortable going into the world of drug for example if your first time doing lsd just scare the shit out of you and you do n't enjoy it you should not do it again until you experience a serious change of perspective if it 's fun sometimes but there were still some scary part feel free to try again in a couple month but definitely do not move on to another drug like shrooms or dmt both of those are much more potent body and mind high drug that you can not handle if lsd is at all foreign to you,0

my grade are failing and i 'm not doing anything about them i 'm not even sure i know what to do about them at this point but that doe n't change that i did originally know what to do and did n't do anything in my speech class we 're working on a project i do n't understand what i 'm supposed to do and the leader of the group is n't having that i try to explain that i do n't understand but she wo n't help me it doe n't help that i have anxiety but is it really anxiety if i do n't feel anxious about it honestly because of how worthless i feel while working with her i 'd rather get a zero than keep working on it not like it 'd make a difference for either of u but anxiety prevents me from doing that she also told me to work on the presentation for the project but she did n't specify what she just said to work on whatever i do n't always know what i 'm supposed to do unless you give me something specific so when i end up either doing nothing or just making small change she 's probably going to get angry even after i explain and honestly if she wonder why i 'm the way i am then i could n't tell her because i do n't even know why i 'm like this in my math class i 'm always late because i have pe before then and it 's on the other side of the school if i 'm late again i 'm going to get kicked out of the class when i tried to explain why i wa always late she said that people who are farther away can still make it on time how though my homeroom teacher keep reminding me that i have terrible grade but it only make me feel worse i 'm addicted to my phone let 's face it and i 'm on it or another device most of the time to the point i do n't have a life i know that if i do n't change that i 'll end up in a worse situation i wish there wa a way to just stop existing so i 'd never have to deal with it but i also would n't make people sad i do n't even think there 'd be much of a difference in the rest of the world if that happened what do you think about me thinking i 'm worthless,1
we do n't really talk about it though folk in society tend to be more interested in those question we obviously joked about fragging guy after mission but it wa n't something that wa brought up much at later time if that make sense,0
they spent so much time money and effort for me to turn out like this i wish i had to energy to work or go to school so i do n't feel like i wasted their money to be a lazy fat as who sleep all day and eats their food i do n't have the energy to leave bed most day i do n't even know how i can find a job or think of a career to study,1
is anyone else waiting to hear back on an interview i just want to know how thing are going for you guy because i just ca n't stand the wait i want to hear one way or the other but i also know that if i were not to get it i 'd want to be back here with the possibility of getting it again ugh and apparently it 's going to be week until i hear back so ironically i also do n't want to hear back until close to that timeframe because hearing back sooner mean my interview probably did n't go well and they can say no quicker than a yes i 'm overthinking this i just would love to work there,0
i m going down again where do i begin i 'll give you some information first not that anyone would read this i 'm just writing at this point for the sake of it i guess anyway i 'm only and i 'm not one of those stupid omg i 'm so insert very real horrible condition here i got tested and turned out to have medium depression if that wa what it wa called i ca n't remember almost two year ago i wa able to fight if off though more like a hope of luck i never got any help my dad said you 're too young to be depressed i wa spiraling down and it felt like everything wa getting worse every time i sacrificed fulfillment happiness and esteem for well just getting my work done my school ha way too much homework like page if you 're lucky for kindergarten much le middle school i pity highschoolers sorry for the tangent even when i got summer i felt so bad i did n't help at that point i realized that i wa n't chasing anything i wa in my position that wa good but i still felt horrible i lost hope it took me a while a little more than a year to get better i 'm doing better and i 'm really happy to say that i 'm doing so much better but now a feel something new i feel in disgust like i did something wrong i also now are extremely anxious i 'm not saying it clinical like the mental disorder i 'm not an idiot that think cause i ca n't speak out in front of the class mean i have social anxiety it just feel like i 'm forgetting thing i hide the way i feel since i just do n't like to make people feel like i 'm in pain and now i feel like i 'm falling back down what do i do i still feel like no one 's going to read this i 'm desperate,1
thinking of starting a journal i 've never written a diary before or had a journal i think i tried it when i wa a kid but it never lasted long i have pretty bad hypochondria and i get stressed a lot so i 'm mostly hoping i 'll be able to track part of that if i stick to writing in it have you ever journaled what kind of thing do you write ha it helped you,0
am i just kidding myself i think i 've hit one of my lowest point yet but if i had to give reason for it they would all come out in a garbled incomprehensible mess reasoning through my issue is n't helping very much either i guess a little background might help i 'm and married and i have a little girl not too long ago i wa in graduate school for school psychology but the pressure of that program wa so intense and they frankly did n't know what to do with me i 'm hard of hearing deeply depressed and have struggled for over half my life with intense ocd tendency and high anxiety all of this translated into a clumsy humiliating few year in grad school and it felt like every kind of embarrassment i could suffer i did after another person in my program committed suicide i took it a an exit call i collected a useless master 's degree and left now i 've taken a much lower-paying job locally and more often than not i flounder at it sometimes i think i 'm inherently not good enough other time i feel like i 've failed everyone and i 'm not up to standard even when i 'm feeling le depressed it 's never been more clear to me that i 'm immature moody have no useful talent and am not nearly a smart a i make myself out to be and i genuinely do n't believe it when people tell me otherwise what is there to be happy about when you really think you have no worth how many time can i mess up before i have to recognize that i 'm not worth anyone 's time how long do i have to stumble all over myself to realize i 'm not useful and doe my daughter really deserve to have such a loser for a father doe n't my wife deserve much better than what she ha with me these are the question that i ask myself every day in-between thinking about all my worst and stupidest moment and planning the least intrusive way to end my life sometimes i wish it wa obvious that no one cared about or valued me i would n't have to think about any of this i 'd just kill myself quickly and stop my bitching instead i have to think about what it would do to the people i leave behind i know it 's delusional to think they 'll get over it but i also ca n't see a future where anything get better it feel like nothing ha been truly better for year,1
i 'm just saying that when people 's favourite movie are the lion king or something i feel like it implies that they do n't like thought-provoking art which again is fine in and of itself but can also be a relationship incompatibility i 'm just going to keep posting this until you remember you said it lol,0

edit my use of triggering in the title refers to how i felt reading article and comment regarding robin williams on the night of not the anger i felt the next day after having time to think and refresh it anger me to see post saying if only robin williams knew how many people cared/ loved him/ are sad now in my bout with depression i would n't have cared if billion people sent card saying they care or page letter or a 16-hour phone call i 'd still throw the card or letter away or hang up the phone and think they do n't really care they just do n't want my death on their conscience i 'd bet money robin williams wa the same way who could be more loved than a funny-man when someone tell me in the context of suicide i 'd be sad if you died i think great so i should endure my pain every day because you do n't want to feel pain yourself i think how selfish how is it more selfish to desire an end to my pain than it is want me to remain in pain it 's easy for the other person to ask me to remain in pain they do n't feel it they do n't see it because if i show it hey perk up be happy turn that frown upside down depression is n't an on/ off switch and so i never want someone to do something they do n't want to do i can remember one time that all i wanted wa to play a particular board game with a friend but i could n't bring myself to say that i did n't want my friend to play just because i asked or out of some moral obligation and i know that if i did at the end i 'd hear do you feel better a if they were just going through a undesirable task to make me le sad instead i just sat there and said and did nothing for the rest of the evening watching my friend get frustrated and angry with me the robin williams post are triggering because they are filled with ignorant comment about caring if i die million will never know much le billion much le care a one /r/self post proclaims friend and family will move on because their advice to me is always keep putting one foot in front of the other just let go of that bad stuff obligatory edit thanks for the gold kind stranger it 's my first,1

this bottled up for most of my life and i do n't have anyone who i could talk to about this a a kid i wa sent to a therapist because my parent and school noticed a change in my personality i went from a bright outgoing kid to a more quiet reserved personality i 've never believed that i wa actually depressed a a child but recently i 've begun to think that maybe i 've been depressed ever since i wa a child when i wa a kid my dad wa stressed from his job and would be easily irritable dad coming home wa always a negative part of my day i would go up to my room and just stay there a much a i could in the hope of not having to interact with him this pretty much meant that my only interaction with my dad growing up wa when i would get in trouble for mostly school or chore related stuff typical kid thing but my dad also liked to put me down whenever he could he would be a jerk to me for no reason i never noticed it growing up i just thought that wa how thing went this went well on past high school i did n't even realize it until my mom and younger sister mentioned it to me when he wa being a jerk to me at a wedding we attended i do n't really have a relationship with my dad and now that my parent are divorced i do n't really see the relationship ever getting better despite the fact that he only life 20min away i helped him move out of the house when the divorce wa finalized something he ha never helped me with whenever i moved i remember him calling me to meet up for lunch when i had heard about the divorce i had to call my mom because it wa so out of the norm that i could n't help but think there must be another reason for it i could n't believe that he just wanted to talk thing are better i guess but maybe that 's because i do n't see him much anymore i do n't have any self-esteem is this because of my dad putting me down all the time maybe when thing would get to me growing up i would always snuggle my cat this of course would lead to more shit talking from my dad about how i wa always with my cat but my cat have been the only thing where i 've felt truly loved my cat enjoy my company and i know that but with people i feel like they 're just being nice to me that everyone i meet is just an acquaintance who really do n't care about me that every compliment i receive is just the other person being nice nobody truly want my company and i understand that i 'm almost with nothing to show for my life i 've never spoken to people about my issue because i do n't want to burden somebody with my issue probably the biggest thing that drag me down is that i have the potential for a lot of stuff i 'm very smart and can think out of the box to solve problem but i have no motivation absolutely zero motivation a a teen i wa told that my body produce very low level of dopamine which is the chemical in your body that fuel your sense of reward/satisfaction for completing goal i wa on pill for a little bit and then stopped taking them i do n't really know why but i feel worthless i try and do college but lose motivation eventually it 's the story of my life really i will do really well and then gradually slip up until i fuck everything up and then i 'll lie about thing hoping that people wo n't know how much im fucking up until it get revealed like today i know i 'm a piece of shit i 'm not a good person people should n't have to deal with me and my problem if all i 'm doing is making their life worse i live with my mom and two little sister right now and watching the difference in treatment they receive growing up compared to how i wa treated also get to me i feel like i wa the practice kid a a kid i walked everywhere i did n't want to bother my parent by asking them for a ride to place so i would walk i would to school church friend anywhere i would get there soaked because i walked or rode my bike in the rain but for my sister she always ha a ride set up for her wherever she go i 'll get scolded because i asked my sister to meet me behind the school so i could pick her up the same spot i would get picked up and dropped off when i did get a ride a a kid instead of driving around the block and picking her up at the front of the school my parent are worried that the recent divorce will upset her and try hard to make sure that their problem do n't bother her punishment are always super light or are ignored i set a pretty low bar i thought for high school i passed my class failed a couple but still graduated i spent the vast majority of my high school year grounded because my grade were low i wa told that if i had to take summer school i would be paying for it and i know for sure i would 've been grounded my sister failed multiple class last year and had to take summer school not only wa she not grounded at all but she wa still allowed to spend or week at a summer camp she really enjoys i do n't have any negative feeling towards my sister i love them very much and know that this is n't something they are responsible for but it just watching them receive the care and affection that i did n't that really get to me even to this day it saddens me when people talk about how they get along really well with their parent because it something i 'll never have i have no relationship with my dad and my mom i feel like i 'm becoming more and more distant from due to my own action but my parent will plan trip for my sister constantly going out and doing thing together i barely had that i feel left out i guess like your an adult now so your problem are your own despite the fact that you 've had them for year it just the constant day to day small thing that get me because i wa never treated that way and it keep adding up.i put on a mask everyday pretending that everything is fine i 've worn this mask all of my life and i 'm fucking good at faking it i make people laugh i 'm easy to talk to and i can strike up a conversation with just about anyone but it 's all fake on the inside i am insecure i hope people will like me but i never believe that people truly do i used to think that thing would change but they have n't i 've never had a romantic relationship i 've had opportunity where i could 've dated but i 've got so much shit to deal with that i do n't want to share that with somebody especially a person i love i do n't want to drag down somebody else because i 'm worthless i 've got one friend plus a small handful of people who i can hang out with but i constantly question those friendship i question my relation with my best friend sometimes are we really good friend or am i just latching on to the one person who seems like they enjoy my company somewhat suicide used to be something i would never do because i know it would devastate my sister and my mom but now i start to think that maybe the pain she would endure from my death would be easier than the pain of having to deal with me and my shit i 'm just tired of being a failure,1
honestly all day i 'll just keep busy and hope every second of the day to be over sooner i really loathe this day,0

i just want to get by i 'm not even asking to be happy i already know that 's a luxury but everyone want something i have so little time i 'm just so tired everything is just too much i want to run away i want to bury my head in the sand i 'm tired of having to put on a performance i 'm tired of having to work so hard it would just be easier to simply not be,1

dealing with daily thought i 'll be finishing college soon and starting a job but lately the last few month or so i 've had suicidal thought daily i 'm just curious to hear about others and how they 're dealing with their thought most day if i just leave my apartment and try to walk or just distract myself that help i do n't have any sort of active plan to take my life so at this point i 'm not really interested in doing therapy i kind of just want to see how i feel after i graduate to decide any sort of plan of action i 've done talk counseling before and it did help and gave me some strategy to deal with anxiety but the underlying depression ha always been there basically i 'm just trying to see what other people 's motivation or grounder to their life i do n't want to die i just do n't want to feel like this anymore,1
for me i want people to pay attention to me i feel better when people take interest in me and want to hear from me i like the attention and i 'm sure that 's some kind of symptom of my depression the fact that i feel i need people to pay attention to me to feel validated so i think i 've lead myself over and over to either one of two situation either i choose someone who ha some major issue that i make myself feel validated by fixing which lead to some codependent stuff and i feel stifled or i pick someone more normal and feel hurt when they ca n't give me all the attention i want and get increasingly more desperate to grab onto something i know it 's my fault that i will never find someone who can actually be healthy for me i 've gotten to the point in my life where everything else is falling into place except this this loneliness is a trigger for my depression and the thought that it 's all because of me and who i am that i will never find someone to share my life with just really drag me down sometimes,1

i 'm grateful for the time i 'm not depressed and can function fairly normally but i 've noticed that when i 'm in the midst of a depressive episode my thought about the world seem to be a lot more accurate and bleak and then i wonder if it 's better to be depressed and honest about life or to be in la-la land,1
i hope my depression get depression and realizes how crippling depression is and decides to stop giving me depression,1

it like there is something holding you back from even enjoying yourself and honestly my insecurity keep messing with me to the point im only focusing on them instead and i have this constant thought that everyone is not genuine with me and it just a lie or the fact that they feel bad for me,1

i 've spent hour lying on the bed this afternoon it 's so hard to convince yourself because there 's nothing to look forward to nobody to talk to and you can not find the reason for self-care it 's easier to stay in bed and struggle about thing like self-hatred sexuality all the type of relationship and the future than to take step to improve the situation it 's so hard when you have no emotional support nobody cheering you on and nobody to go through thing with you step-by-step nobody 's listening i 'm aware that i can not and should not rely on other for validation and i can not seek their help all the time i 'm aware that only i can change thing but a soon a i 'm trying to be independent everything just fall apart immediately why am i like this i just want the demon to go away i do n't need to be happy i just want this to stop,1

i set fire to everything i touch i have lost all hope and i have no where else to turn i have no friend to talk to and i haven t spoken to my family in almost year basically i have suffered from depression in some form since i wa around i will be on sunday and i can t take it anymore i can t remember a time in my life where my parent ever hugged me or gave me any affection and the have never told me they loved me however they have told me how much of a loser i am and been overly critical of everything i have ever done so realizing that they were toxic for me i ceased all communication with them and forfeit any idea that they would ever change they last or year thing have just gotten unbearable for me i think the depression flared up in a major way when my wife miscarried our first child the whole situation really sent me into a downward spiral that i have yet to recover from that event brought a lot of stress and problem into our marriage during that time i began seeing a physiatrist and also began taking medication this seemed to help somewhat with my mood but it also introduced side effect and i began the carousel of medication change about a year later we got pregnant again and later my daughter wa born i really feel like my depression robbed me of that euphoric feeling of endless love for your child that everyone describes i really felt nothing although i know i wa supposed to love her soon after month my daughter wa born my wife could not take living with a depressed person any more and she decided to move out with her mother and we separated i continued to go to therapy and my phycologist to try and improve my symptom and get my family back for the next six month thing just seemed to get worse between u and it all led me to a suicide attempt it failed obviously but it led me to be hospitalized in a psychiatric unit were i wa once again but on diffent med through all of this i continued therapy after getting out and eventually convinced my wife to do couple therapy all in hope i would get my only friend back and be able to bond and build a relationship with my young daughter she eventually decided to file for divorce she said it wa to protect or daughter from me being able to get her at anytime she wanted legal print in place for protection basically obviously my condition continued to deteriorate but we were still trying to work on thing i voluntarily checked myself into a different highly acclaimed physiatrist hostpital to try and address my suicidal feeling and depression i had been suffering from the past several year once again thing got momentarily better but soon after i wa still feeling the same and having the same thought of harming myself this pattern continued and eventually she finalized the divorce i wa hospitalized again i lost my wife and my daughter she got the court to agree that i am unable to see my daughter without supervision so basically i can t be alone with her it make it very difficult to do since i have no friend and the only family i have that i speak to and that care about me is my year old grandmother during this time i also wa looked over for a promotion at work that i told i wa going to get but didn t i have never given up hope that we could get back together and we would be able to be a family and i would get better and get to be close to my daughter but to top it all off i just found out my ex wife ha now began dating someone new she wa my only friend and now that she is seeing someone she keep conversation strictly to our now year old daughter so the only people i have in this world is my daughter who won t even hug me and my grandmother and when i lose her i don t know what i will do i have thought about suicide multiple time a day for a long a i can remember it s really the only thing that could end the pain i am not an easy person to get along with and i have so little self worth and no redeeming quality that i truly believe my daughter would be much better off without me especially if i were to go now while she is young and ha formed no memory of me i m really just rambling at this point and it is probably a wall of text but i have no where else to turn a i have since given up on med and therapy and have just become a resentful bitter depressed and suicidal person who is literally unlovable,1

depression is n't an emotion depression ha no cause too often is depression conflated with sadness or anxiety i came out to my bos over my depression a while ago and though he is one of the most kind and understanding people i know he wo n't mention it he sometimes asks me how my anxiety is doing depression when it is present is more like the force of gravity it is there pulling down on you under all circumstance though i 'm depressed i am often very happy- but still there is the unfeeling wet blanket of muddled confusion and writhing frustration seething under it all waiting a creeping numbness that insidiously degrades and diminishes every aspect of conscious life a storm of screaming and hatred in dream a dull apathy in waking a sinking stomach in the face of joy and a faithless lassitude in the face of hope depression is n't an emotion depression is a contradiction to every worthy aspect of life,1
my parent are fucking sad sack like me i ca n't handle the fact that my mom is so emotionally destroyed all the time about the course of my life and life of my sibling it make me want to distance myself from her a much a fucking possible i do n't care how alone she feel her emotional problem are too much of a burden for me to bear and i can not be asked to be responsible for my mother 's happiness i do n't care how she feel being abandoned or my sibling for that matter they are too much for me to handle i just wish everyone else in my family wa fucking emotionally stable because they make their emotional problem a burden for everyone else i fucking resent them for this because i do not make my emotion anyone else 's problem i do n't make my life anyone else 's problem even when i am certain i ca n't find the solution to my problem on my own i always take the intiative to solve my own problem and if i do n't i do n't fucking bother anyone else about it and i also do n't sit around and cry like a fucking child even though i hate my existence and wish i wa dead i ca n't be asked to bear the burden of having to hear my mother whine about how she feel like she wa n't a good enough mom which is always going to be the conclusion she will come to if i stay a failure or kill myself what she doe n't realize though is that she is irresponsibly making her emotion a horrible burden to me making me feel ashamed all while also making me responsible for making her feel like she wa n't a failure of a mother and if i go and tell that she is enough that wa always and always be enough she will just turn the bullshit on me i do n't give a fuck if her genuine reasoning is to wonder why i am such an objective failure if she wa a good enough mother it 's just the kind of insidious vicious cycle brought on by her own insecurity that i can not be asked to handle every time they come up i 'm sorry it just make me want to kill myself even more because what she is essentially doing is blaming me for her unhappiness and i will resent her for it ever fucking day of my life and i do n't care how she ended up like that because it make my life a little bit more hellish to have to deal with it i 'm sick of having parent that feel sorry for themselves but then put the responsibility and weight of those feeling onto other people and it hurt because it 's not like i do n't understand where she is coming from i do and that 's why i understand how much of a confusing hellish mess her emotion are rant over,1
i feel like i 'm done i do n't know what to do u i do n't know what to do i knew this day would come because i 've done a pretty poor job of managing my life for the last year though people would never ever know it now everything everything is imploding it 's totally my fault but i could n't handle myself at my best and god know i 'm at my worst now i ca n't fake that i 'm ok anymore and i 'm le ok than i ever have been the last year have been a really un-fun waterslide to the bottom so now what what are my option here i have a job with health insurance but probably not for long i 've fucked up no one know the extent yet not catastrophic but pretty fucking bad and i know i 'm not going in tomorrow a i have n't more and more over the last few month i 'm having a real hard time leaving my house even if i do manage that the subway platform is far too tempting i have pet that i have no idea what to do with if i need to be somewhere for a while i have no friend or anyone who can take them so what do i do,1
everything is a mess in the last year a friend of mine wa almost murdered and two others died my friend essentially decided they were sick of me i have one friend i m so tired a teacher at my school told me everyone would leave me because i wa too much for anyone to ever love and i understand that my dad seems to want to forget about his old life and move on with his wife and i m a part of his old life so we barely talk my mom tolerates me sometimes i don t care anymore i m graduating in five week and i want to be dead before then i knew when i wa a kid i would die before i wa and it might just be a self fulfilling prophecy but i don t care i just want to go to sleep,1
deep down i knew it would happen but i tried being positive for once and got my hope up never again i thought it would really hurt but i feel nothing just numbness,1

have n't been a student in a while but my top recommendation go to every class do n't skip you 'll get more margin for error on the study material at home aka slack off there and going to class is more useful because you 'll usually get a better idea of what the professor care about but more importantly sit in the same spot every single day doe n't need to be in the front but always the same spot make sure your professor learns your name a early a possible so they can associate it with the face quickly say one thing every single class no do n't be that kid you do n't need to be obnoxious or annoying just one clarifying question or make one insightful comment if you have it and it 's actually relevant and at minimum a simple could you expand on that last point will do the trick so basically you 're making sure the professor know your name know you show up every single day and know you 're engaged on this tip alone i received more grade boost than you could possibly imagine i got a final grade of an a+ in a class i got a b+ on the midterm i also got an a on a class where i 'm sure it mathed out to a b+ or a- beyond that if you 're in an essay-writing field suck it up and do them early it doe n't cost you anything you have to do it anyway or at least the outline or first few page and bring it to your ta or professor for feedback you 'll almost always get an a by applying their guidance finally master tip before exam stand up with a piece of paper and say if you 'd like to be in a study group to provide an email collect email go home build the skeleton of an outline of a study document that fit your preferred learning style if they wanted it in their style they could have organized it be it by chapter concept get it a detailed a you want mine would have bullet and sub-bullets and sub-sub-bullets email it to everyone with ground rule good one to start are cite any information provided with book/page or lecture/date etc and provide name anyone not participating get booted use the top of the document to book study session if necessary create time slot on your schedule if they wanted it on their schedule they could have organized it now you 've crowd-sourced a far more comprehensive piece of study material than you could have ever produced by your lone self doing this plus coordinating the study group and attending every lecture i rarely did any reading and never suffered for it good luck,0

i need some help considering suicide i m pretty new to this subreddit so i m not sure what the rule are but i need some help a couple week ago me and my parent got into a pretty big fight and i came out of it feeling pretty useless and like i wa a burden on everyone in my life throughout the course of my life me and my parent have always disagreed on stuff and had fight it s just part of life however when it s all said and done my parent say that they still love me part of me want to believe it but another-darker- part of me doesn t even consider the possibly that anyone could love me i ve gotten used to being yelled at and containing my feeling during these fight but afterwords i break down and cry in my bed with thought of suicide filling my mind a i sob into my pillow the most prominent of these thought being that i m worthless and that i have no purpose in life other than being a burden on everyone the only reason i haven t actually done it yet is that i m terrified of what s going to happen afterwords i already know what people are going to say since they ve all said it before you have so much to live for you have your whole life ahead of you you ll get past it this is really just a last resort for me and i m not really sure i can be talked out of these feeling but it s worth a try right,1

i ca n't find the name but in a torture museum i visited they had this rocking horse studded with spike and chain if a kid behaved horribly during class they would have to sit on the chair and rock the whole day not the craziest torture here but still pretty crazy considering how deep the spike were and the possibility of infection especially just for a child i think it had something to do with being called a jack as it might have been a donkey either way it wa meant to humiliate the hell out of the kid and their parent,0

what to do with a half-eaten box of girl scout cooky my parent sent u an easter gift package and inside there were a few gift including several box of girl scout cooky going through the box we realized that one of the box wa open chuckling to myself a my mom love to pack gift inside unexpected box i open it and it an open package of tagalong with several cooky missing cracking up and assuming another family member must have munched on them i eat one and put it aside now i 've come to find out that my parent had no idea the box wa open and no one ha fessed up we 're not kid anymore so this is the kind of thing that most of u would own up to with great bravado the box wa packaged by my mom and i find it unlikely that a ups employee would open the box just to eat a few cooky i also think it unlikely that a girl scout would accidentally sell an opened box but it possible my mom of course think i should toss them that sound like a waste of cooky to me and i 've already had one besides what would you do and where do you think the cooky went keep in mind not these are little brownie baker and not the locally sold and quite inferior abc baker,0

the pain of existence so i 've been looking for a place to vent i do n't feel like i 'm in immediate danger but at the same time i do i do n't know where to start so i 'm just going to start venting i am and have battled with depression for most of my adult life i would say a huge factor in this is my father he 's a good person and love me i know but he ha his own demon there is a very personal past with my grandfather that gave him his own issue mostly anger this led me to spend most of my pubescent time doing what my dad wanted me to do spending time with him trying to make him happy trying to keep him from getting angry i think the main result of this wa at the time i should have been developing social skill i wa n't this left me with crippling social anxiety and i have no true friend and i often feel i have no clue how to communicate especially with the opposite sex i 'm extremely extremely lonely there is much more to this but i do n't want to get too personal in public this started me down my path couple this with the fact that when wa i wa diagnosed with a chronic back condition while we were diagnosing this and figuring out what treatment work for me i spent month in bed and slipped into a deep depression that i spent year ignoring i spent some of this time contemplating suicide very seriously just to escape the pain eventually we were able to control the pain but the depression stayed fast forward to last year bad i finally sought help for the depression and anxiety issue i have been having i have been fighting for every inch of progress and i feel like i have a mountain left to climb i still battle with a certain disregard for whether i wake up in the morning if not actively suicidal now i have had a massive resurgence of back pain that ha n't responded to treatment and i am spending hour a day in near unbearable pain i do n't want to live if this is what existence is going to be like the pain ha consumed my mind and i ca n't help but pause for a second every time i see a viable way to stop the pain the pain ha become everything i am consumed me and my mind all i can think about is ending this pain the loneliness the emotional pain and the physical i have no fight left i have lost all will and energy to resist and i 'm scared of what every passing hour of pain is bringing me closer to i 've admitted that i will be alone forever and i 'm afraid i will be in pain forever i do n't want all that pain to last for another year i enjoy nothing and have no one i love to go be miserable and in pain in a shitty job just so i can barely scrape by overcoming my lack of courage will be my final act it 's just a matter of how long i last,1

do you people expect others 'to-be-friends in general to show same level of empathy a you would show for them i wa having this discussion with my therapist the other day where i said that i choose my friend based on the fact whether they would care for me a much a i care for them if yes then we turn out to be really good and close friend or else i let them go basically 'ghost them for not suffering the pain in the long run although letting them go is really agonizing but only in the short run the result of this is that i have had very few but close friend throughout my life 's journey so far and now i have moved to a different place and am having a hard time finding people by following my original philosophy i wanted your opinion on this what do you do to decide whether a person is worth keeping friendship with or not and if it is wrong to anticipate the same level of empathy from them a you would show,0

3am i just need to vent cuz i can t sleep not sure if this is the appropriate sub for this sorry to start off i am a lesbian my girlfriend and i were in a long distance relationship for year almost she visited me in october of for what would be the last time stayed a month and then went home we had a long conversation about loneliness and family the day before she left i thought thing would be fine shortly after arriving home she became very distant with me and blamed it on a sudden depressive episode i believe this still because she s had problem with that in the past she express that she is suicidal and of course i m worried for her after a few week of sparse interaction and me freaking out a lot she say she s going to get help and then pretty much drop off the map for me i am convinced she ha killed herself and lied about going to the hospital what i don t know is that she s blocked me on pretty much every platform and decided to move on with her life i did not find out about this until february so around three month later after effectively failing to get in touch with her or any family and pretty much grieving someone i thought i had lost to suicide i also struggle with mental issue bipolar and ptsd and i felt i could not cope with this so i saw a counselor and a doctor to medicate me and help me move on i wa beginning to feel like i could move forward with my life however after finding out she just ghosted me and nothing happened to her i had a huge nervous breakdown and relapsed since then i have lost a lot of weight from just not eating and i find myself cry constantly like inconsolably i m unhappy i ve withdrawn a lot from my social circle and i ve dropped so many hobby that used to make me happy because they remind me of her i have nightmare about her damn near every night i have no idea what to do i really just want to lay down and die i don t blame her at all i respect her decision to leave me in whatever way she s chosen i just don t understand why i wasn t even worth a text or a phone call telling me that it s over i don t know how to pick myself up even when i try if i manage to get through the whole day without thinking of her i still have this stupid recurring dream of carrying her body to a train station to go to her funeral but fucking up over and over and taking the wrong train or not having the money losing my ticket etc etc i can t even tell anyone because i m not out to my family or current friend i figured i d feel better writing it somewhere at least i know this is like a first world problem and i m being dramatic but it hurt so much it been month but i still haven t gotten over it it s just a stupid breakup and everyone ha those i don t wan na die but it feel like i m kind of wasting away anyway i can t force myself to eat or take care of myself or talk to anyone anyway thanks for listening,1

trying to figure out how to face another day so i 've been trying to convince myself i 'm ok but i ca n't keep up the charade any longer i 've been living a good respectable responsible life for about a year now but i do n't know how to do it any more the problem in my life are so complicated and confusing regarding legal and family mess that i wo n't begin to try to explain my current situation just know that it 's killing me inside and i 've been trying my hardest to figure out solution and i just do n't think there are any i 've seen a ton of different p-docs and therapist been on just about every combo of med you can think of and even been in inpatient care time over the course of my life i finally just had to stop taking any med because they were n't helping toward the end of my time on med the combo i wa on wa sedating me so badly that i kept falling asleep during the day and had no motivation and my family berated me over how worthless and lazy and selfish i wa then my doc changed my med and i suddenly started having homicidal thought i gave up and quit all the med and p-docs and therapist kept using my same-sex attraction a a symptom of mental illness or a a sign of downright moral failure yeah i 'm a lesbian one doctor mocked me one told me i wa on my way to hell one told me he wa good at fixing people like me one crisis case manager even prayed over me and insisted that i study the bible for my own safety i have to hide my sexual orientation from my family and most people i know i 'm year old and have n't even so much a kissed a woman in nearly year my life ha been a jumble of abuse rape suicide attempt self-harm a home invasion involving two dude with a shotgun hallucination panic attack a few life-threatening health crisis aside from the suicide attempt and the list just keep going i look back and realize that there are large chunk of my life that i ca n't remember i see photo that i 'm in or that i took and ca n't recognize them lately more and more the people around me seem strange and alien my surroundings grow louder and more chaotic every day and everything seems to move faster and faster and it feel like it 's all coming toward me i start to twitch sometimes because it physically hurt me and make my mind kind of short-circuit when all the sound and motion and light get to be overwhelming but i have to try to suppress it because year ago a p-doc supposedly told my mom that i do thing like that on purpose to try to get attention and pity so my family can get really disgusted with me if they see it i do n't recognize my own face in the mirror i do n't recognize my own voice nothing seems real anymore and sometimes i even feel sort of like i 'm coming out of my body no it 's not drug i have smoked marijuana once in the past year and i ca n't remember ever doing any actual bad drug and before those year back when i wa younger i think i only ever smoked week time altogether when i try to remember thing in the past my chronology get all out of order and there are discontinuity and thing that seem impossible in life and reality in general there are so many contradiction and absurdity it just feel like reality ca n't be real i just want to escape i do n't really want to be dead but i want to be somewhere that make sense and maybe there just is n't such a place and being where i am now make so little sense that i feel like there 's this unspeakable and eternal scream of wordless horror inside my chest like all the assumption that we make about how reality work about how thing supposedly have some sort of order and reason and logic i feel like maybe all those assumption are just wrong and i feel like reality could just break any minute and then where the hell would i end up maybe it 's slowly breaking already really i think it might help to just have some quiet alone time for a while get some rest but i ca n't miss work and even when i 'm not at work i 'm dealing with my insane family and my home is so effing loud and at work it 's utterly insane because my company is falling apart and i 'm expected to do the work of several people while still also being super peppy and convincing all our customer to buy a ton of stuff they do n't want and my bos is a terrible person who make her employee miserable and i 'm just so so so so tired edit/update it 's a day later now today i had a great day worked my as off at work and accomplished a lot it made me feel a lot better i think i 'll be ok for now thanks for reading,1

i realized a few day ago that i wa suffering from maladaptive daydreaming for the last years.for those who don t know about maladaptive daydreaming http //www.google.co.in/url sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=web cd=1 ved=0ahukewiynrjw2mllahxqwy4khznachkqfggbmaa url=https 3a 2f 2fen.wikipedia.org 2fwiki 2fmaladaptive_daydreaming usg=afqjcnh7sxzedx3biclpczmznwn4mtrjqg bvm=bv.116636494 d.c2e cad=rja physically i wa living one life and mentally i wa living version of myself.this may sound ridiculous but it is true all my life i thought i had no dream aim goal aspiration or whatever.i wa lackadaisical about most of the thing in life during 8th grade i started daydreaming.at that time i thought it wa probably the best use i can make of my mind.i can be anyone i want.i can do anything i want.i can do this by just imagining stuff.for hour i dreamt about thing that i wanted.at that time i wanted to be a footballer i would imagine playing for my favourite football club playing for my country.all of those scenario i made up my mind.i became lazier.the girl i had a crush on i would imagine spending time with her.the same thing continued for year a i took admission in an average college i started to imagine that i am in a top well known college returning home after college i resume my daydreaming again there wa a point when i thought sleeping is a better option.i had dream per session of sleep my life had become so boring that i used to sleep for about hour so that i could have something interesting atleast in my dreams.the daydreaming wa not going to end i had version of myself which i roleplayed in my mind a football player 2.an ordinary citizen with a good job and a so 3.this roleplay wa used by me for nsfw purpose after college being indecisive a ever these version started influencing me i spent more time daydreaming.after i failed to crack an exam required for higher education i started daydreaming about successfully cracking that exam and taking admission to a new college all the failure in my life were overshadowed by daydreaming.maybe this is why i am jobless with no life at all.i wa a depressed a one can get i tried to quit this habit of daydreaming all the character that i created in my fantasy spoke with me all the time i try to avoid them a much a i can but they have become a part of me a of now i have nt daydreamed for a day and this probably is the longest i ve gone.thank you for reading this and no i don t have suicidal thought,1

almost every time /r/depression get mentioned in other sub such a this askreddit thread http //www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2wri29/which_subreddit_would_you_like_to_shake_some/cotkc4w context=3 people say how this place is toxic and that people here would rather talk about how depressed they are rather than way to get better think about that they 're literally condemning u for not being optimistic enough they claim they take depression seriously and how 'difficult it can be to face but if you are so depressed that you 're consumed by apathy and hopelessness then they stop pretending to care and tell you to stop feeling sorry for yourself and to go do something about it it 's like they think venting and looking for emotional validation and support is the worst thing a depressed person can do obviously being told a hundred time to exercise go to a therapist and meditate is the most helpful i wa doubtful the first time but that last one sure changed my life the worst part is that a lot of the time it 's people who used to have depression saying these thing you know those with the if i can do it so can you mentality similar to ex-smokers and ex-fat people in that regard it just seems like the more depressed you are the le people want to help and if they do try to help they get angry if their advice and platitude are n't met with anything other than gratitude and positivity that 's why i wonder if i should even bother opening up to my friend and family knowing them they 'd do the exact same thing sorry for the long rant perhaps a positive ending to counteract all that toxic nonsense ahem i love all you guy so much we got this a long a we believe in ourselves woo ddd ^^okay ^^let ^^me ^^throw ^^up now,1

i seriously do not remember the last time i felt an emotion that wa my own beyond the alternating crushing ennui and bone-deep sadness that is the depression any normal emotion happiness laughter excitement even just normal neutrality all of those are foreign to me i only feel them when i 'm near someone else who is feeling them and that 's only because i 've learned to mimic the behavior associated with each emotion while in a social setting so nobody will ask what 's wrong with me is this a thing other people do or am i just really fucked up,1

i hate this place and i want to leave i feel like every belief i hold no one understands and those that do are just unreachable i feel like an alien on earth like the only one of my kind all ive ever wanted wa to feel like i belonged to something or someone but the more time go by the more i feel myself slipping into psychosis and the further away that goal get it not worth it anymore,1
saying i want to die is becoming le painful when i say it about year ago i realized i hadn t known what i wanted to do with my life and ever since then the anxiety of falling in a rut in college and not knowing what i wanted to major in would lead me to drop out and i wouldn t amount to anything this only becomes worse with the fact that i m failing several of my class right now and i m so stressed about one of my class that it s consumed almost every second of my life and ha caused me to feel depressed every time i try to study i just can t grasp the concept and it leaf me with even more stress failing a class doesn t usually hit me a hard a this ha because i can usually bring the grade up to at least a b+ but i ve hit the point that it feel like nothing matter i don t know what i want to do with my life and i m certain i won t ever amount to anything that would make me successful much le happy i have constant anxiety and i stay up until 5am trying to study but i can t do it even trying to study feel like such a chore my gpa is already dropping my class rank is just getting higher and i ve realized i m not smart enough to simply get by on good grade alone so i ve had to resort to trying to figure out what i want to major in and get by on hard work but i can t even figure that out i ve been feeling depressed for about a month or so now and i can t tell if i m subconsciously faking it to get attention or if i m truly depressed i just don t know what to do anymore for year i ve had suicidal thought but when they first started i would break out cry because the thought of doing such a thing wa too much but now it just feel painfully easy to say and i can t even tell if i would actually do it or not it s just an empty feeling at this point and i m sure if i didn t have family or friend who i m scared to disappoint i would have already attempted it it feel like i m just not trying hard enough and i m weak but i can still work myself to exhaustion and fail at everything i do i just really don t know how to handle myself anymore,1
i 'm currently studying a an apprentice which mean full time work and studying i love the job and have done well in the exam and assignment i 'm struggling with the coursework side of stuff i feel i just stick my head in the sand with it and ignore it to the point the college have brought it up i ca n't seem it make myself do the work a it 's very much self assessment and reflection stuff and i hate that stuff i feel so worthless whenever i try to do the work and that i have no idea what i 'm doing when it come to the job i 'm scared they will turn around and tell me they ca n't deal with it and to try again at a later date i feel this is my last chance i have an interview tomorrow about all of it and i feel i 'm just making excuse and seeming lazy i 'm so lost the med are n't helping and i feel shit is all this worth it all k feel now is that i want to shoot myself in the head and be done with it,1

reason to live i ve been falling back into my suicidal and depressive thought more frequently recently and i just need some stuff to live for can someone please help me,1
hi for about a year and a half i 've been feeling pretty sad lately i 've thought from time to time that maybe i am depressed but i 've never accepted it in this day and age it seems like everyone is depressed so ut feel wrong to think that i would be depressed it 's not like i always feel sad but usually in the morning i just feel so lonely even though i have nice caring friend and family what 's a good way to actually find out if i have depression or not tl dr what 's a good easy would also be nice way to see if i 'm actually depressed or not,1
i m senior in college and some day i m in up to four class if i don t have to work that day work requires me to talk i can go through the entire day with having little to no interaction with another human no one text me throughout the day no one talk to me before or after class and i feel a though no one even look at me when i walk down the street beyond the cashier at the cafe telling me my coffee and donut is i feel a though i don t exist i m not suicidal but that doesn t mean the thought that if i d i disappear the entire world would continue moving without noticing hasn t graced my mind to complicate thing i ve even walked by friend best of friend without them noticing me or saying hi even if i make an attempt to i try to just enjoy my walk but being surrounded by so many people make me feel claustrophobic today in particular i decided to dress nicer maybe i d get someone to notice me i wore something my ex-gf had always thought i looked handsome in the painful reality is that i felt even more alone today more distant from the entire society of college that i wanted to run a far a i could away from it people are always telling me that if you want to make friend or meet a girl you have to be the one to make that first conversation but if that s the case why isn t any ever trying to make that conversation with me thank-you for noticing me today,1
ca n't ever find anything i like without it being ruined tired of trying to find stuff that i can enjoy then it turn to shit and make me more depressed this is fucking stupid to even try anymore,1
alright i ll bite and take the consequence for it but i have to agree on this one i did not play the game when it wa new i played it shortly after x-2 released for reference the game did not age well the graphic made it hard for me to figure out thing early in the game i ran around for hour unsure of were to go only to discover there wa a ladder i could climb that i had no idea wa a ladder by looking at it the story i could not follow and did not understand until i played crisis core year later the translation wa bad a well now i loved and enjoyed ten is my favorite but i played it first so that could be a part of it if you grew up on the game i could see how it wa revolutionary for the time but coming back later being told it s the best game of all time i had very high expectation which were not met edit i do plan to play the remake and give it a shot a a new game,0

what 's something you do within the confines of your own home that keep you preoccupied and happy so i 'm on summer break spend most of my time in front of a computer prefer to socialize online irl socialization just is n't for me and when you 're alone with only an internet connection zero friend and no one to talk to and doing everything to combat depression there 's only so much you can do to keep yourself occupied i 'm wondering how you other people fare do you cross-stitch write read book what aside from the common stuff do you do to pas time i 'm genuinely curious,0
there are a lot of thing in life that i deny affect me for example in my last year of middle school and in beginning of high school i would get into physical fight with my dad every day and that s also when my parent were finalizing their divorce during that time i played hour and hour of minecraft and league of legend enough to have my gpa drop down by a whole number and it s around that time that i remember feeling like i had no motivation i would go home and lie in front of the tv and feel like i wa unable to get up from the ground but i also have really bad adhd and upping my dosage helped there so i always say that my gpa then wa bad because i played too many video game not because of my parent and that s what i truly believe and yeah sure my friend were all kinda really mean to me they d call me annoying to my face all the time and tell their friend to laugh at me or they d laugh at me behind my back but i really wa annoying and i just got better at making fun of myself i also have always slept long hour since middle school and nobody ever said anything about it i d sleep hour when i got to sleep in and in high school i d sleep hour at a time sometimes i like to sleep because it s relaxing and i have vivid dream and i feel secure because i don t have to worry about any real world problem it s like a nice pastime i don t feel trapped by it now i m a junior in college and some of my friend have continuously been telling me how they think i m depressed this started after i made a few too many suicide joke or 2meirleirl joke but my mom and my ex both have a lot of reason outside of that and yeah i consider suicide a a rational option but i don t think that s so bad i believe that i m a lazy person who if given other way out of doing something rather than seeing it a a life or death decision will always weasel out and take the easiest route i really do believe that i m someone who ha to see thing a life or death because i have no motivation outside of fear and urgency i can t remember a time where i had motivation to study in the last few month i ve hung out with friend a lot le but my friend know i m an introvert it s always felt a little prematurely exhausting thinking about having to go to event or plan that i created and now it feel super exhausting and i dread having to go to whatever plan people want to make with me i just want to stay alone in my dorm because i m an introvert and i like it but also recently i feel like i have no motivation to even get out of bed and i can t sleep so much anymore i sleep like hour a night because i have a hard time falling asleep but i used to be great at sleeping i feel guilty about a lot of thing like my mom buying me thing when i don t think i ll have a successful future to repay her with but i think im just being rational i guess the main point that i m trying to get across is this everyone think i m depressed and different people have told me this since i wa in 9th grade but i ve always brushed them off these day i ve been having some more difficulty with motivation even though i ve always lacked motivation and i find it difficult to get out of bed or get out of my car or get off the ground i know that there are thing i need to do and i care greatly about them but i have no will to get out of my bed but i m also comfortable this way and i think that it s just a continuation of everything that s normal for me there s a small grain of doubt in my mind that maybe i am really depressed but i can t stop the majority of me that tell myself i m just being rational and realistic about my life and no i don t really have depression i m just lazy and i don t really want to get help because if i don t have it i ll look like a real fool in the doctor office if i do have it but it s super easily amenable then i look silly for being affected by it when it wasn t really a problem at all if i do have it then it mean that thing have been going awry for a while now because i haven t had any true motivation since 9th grade i feel comfortable like this and i feel like this is the correct way of thinking and living if i m too happy or easy on myself then how will i keep myself in check i always take the easiest way out and if i m better i d just let myself believe that there are other option that aren t success or death and i don t want that right now i can t stop going back and forth in my head about whether or not i have it and everyone s getting fed up with me now because i ll accept what they say one day and find it absolutely ridiculous the next i don t know what to do about it i don t like the back and forth either but i genuinely believe both side so i m stuck sorry for the long post and the thing i say here or opinion i hold about depression really only apply to myself with others i m accepting and try my best to be a supportive a i can of their depression i never think these thing about others it s just to myself because i have different value that aren t necessarily right for myself,1

about a week ago my wife left the apartment bought a gun drove somewhere secluded pulled over and shot herself i have been with her since when we were still in high school we became adult together i have always had mildish depression and anxiety but she ha always had major depression and suicidal ideation it just kept getting worse and worse she tried all sort of medication therapy including dbt she had a partial diagnosis for bpd a well i 'm not even exactly sure why i am posting here other than to vent a bit i see a regular therapist and have an appointment monday i am also on an ssri already so i am taking the proper step i just am so beside myself i always knew it would happen she told me it would and that there wa no way to change it i lived in constant fear and anxiety that she would have a breakdown or even kill herself i had to make so many excuse for her to my family throughout the year i could always tell they disproved even if only a little bit of me putting so much effort into her i think they better understand now i do not mean to be dramatic but i feel like even though i do not regret being with her it ha tormented me in a deep possibility irreversible way i know she never meant to harm me and it wa the depressed train of thinking she had but only about a week before she killed herself i finally got her to admit what i suspected for a long time she wa distancing herself from me for month in order to soften the blow of her suicide for month at least she wa purposefully distant did not even try to console me when the situation became too hard for me i felt so alone i hate myself for being just a bit relieved that she is dead because the pain of seeing her suffer wa so unimaginably hard to bear i feel so angry at her parent especially her mom for always putting her down making her feel worthless her mother is the literal worst person i know she always acted a if she supported her daughter in everything she did when out in public but in private she shit on everything she did my wife wa literally a genius at least according to the iq test the doctor gave her when diagnosing her mental illness she wa an incredible artist who painted drew sewed wood burned and a shit ton of other thing anything art she could do and her parent hated that because she did not want to join the navy like them or go into business she wanted to teach and almost achieved her dream before the depression worsened to the point that she quit school and work i just wish could have been different for her all she ever wanted to do wa help people and make the world better i just want to sit on my as and play video game why here and not me i work in correction and see a bunch of scum everyday who love the fuck out of themselves why not them she never hurt a god damn soul edit a name edit i just want everyone to know that i wa hesitant about even posting anything about my situation but i am glad that i did because it ha been very therapeutic i only have two people in my life that really understand depression and how it affect one 's thought feeling and belief most of the people in my life just do not have the ability to comprehend what happened and i am both glad and deeply saddened that the people here do so thank you everyone edit thank you kind stranger for the gold i think i know who is wa but i will just leave it at that edit just a few photo of my wife 's art http //i.imgur.com/vomvgj3undefined.jpg http //i.imgur.com/v7sxmo6undefined.jpg http //i.imgur.com/na9pnnwundefined.jpg http //i.imgur.com/imvcmrvundefined.jpg http //i.imgur.com/9lafoooundefined.jpg http //i.imgur.com/yv7ao1iundefined.jpg http iimgurcoml7xegftundefinedjpg,1
i wa thinking about this the other day in high school even though i did n't get into the university i wanted to they told me i still got into a great school and i would have a great time because everyone had a great time in college when i got there and i wa overworked and over-stressed and having the worst time of my life they told me that everyone hated college but because i got into such a prestigious school that i wa sure to get a good job afterwards when i failed out of that school and wa forced to enroll in community college everyone then started telling me that yeah college suck but it doe n't matter which school you go to you are still going to get a great job afterwards which statistically is highly unlikely and i would really start having fun once i wa in the real world and had a job when i graduated from community college and got a job everyone started telling me that yeah everyone hate their first job but life doe n't start getting really fun until you hit i 'm so fucking sick of it i imagine that the minute i hit people are going to start telling me that everyone hate their 30 and life doe n't start to get really fun until you retire each phase of my life get worse and worse and i keep getting told that the next one is when people start enjoying life some of these people immediately after they tell me no one enjoys life until they reach will tell a depressed high school student the same b they told me when i wa in high school i do n't know if they are aware they are doing this but it 's clear this line of thinking is just wrong my current situation is so bad i 'm starting to get nostalgic over being bullied in middle school and i ca n't tell even my mom about it because she retort darklordsantaclaus you did n't enjoy middle school you were coming home cry every day and i can only respond yeah i know but my current situation is worse,1
coming home moved home recently after ish year of living away think it might just be the worst decision i have ever made i now have constant reminder how everyone s life have moved on without me and how i am now just a burden to them a dark cloud clinging to them which they feel too guilty to get rid of i have just walked alone for hr and counted car i could have should of jumped i front of everything would be better if i wasn t here,1

i 'm concerned about an ex but most think they 're cry for attention i have an ex from a relationship that lasted from high school past college he wa a good boyfriend in the sense that he wa supportive and never abusive or unkind toward me obviously we both changed much throughout that time and devolved into friendship mostly i could not tolerate his seemingly outsized anger his family life wa not ideal his father wa a domineering man short of stature but not the stereotypical desire to live at the gym and judge his son sometimes violently by their athletic prowess try a he might the ex and his older brother did not excel in sport their father 's anger wa physically exercised on the eldest the psychological abuse wa saved for my ex catholic school rod-rotting nun and all coupled with a meek spineless mother added a misogyny bent to the equation watching friend and his brother die in high school from overdoses compounded the pain depression and anger i offer this brief background in the hope it might clarify some of who he is i 'm aware armchair diagnosis are professionally unethical but i 'm truly afraid for his safety and others since we ended our relationship i 've attempted to remain friend however the only communication i receive from him are picture of girl he 's having sex with usually in some degrading form of bondage or message conveying his desperate desire to end his own life oddly his sexual proclivity seem to contradict his deeply held desire not to die while his mother is alive lest she suffer the death of another child actually it 's death of other child that scare me the most while he 's never expressed a fondness for firearm beyond a deep devotion for call of duty he ha unabashedly shown hatred for and said terrible thing about child in general he 's said fuck your kid to me specifically these sentiment coupled with his suicidality really concern me but should i be is he just working me thank you to anyone who 's taken their time to wade through this tl dr is my sadistic somewhat misogynistic ex looking for sympathy with his threat of suicide which are mitigated with his hatred for child and sending degrading sexual photo to unwilling ex or should i genuinely worry he might shot himself or a classroom first,1
how can you not care for at least more than year i have wanted to die and did n't expect to be alive to see myself become an adult at least by law because i did n't expect to be here i never cared much about politics or the future in general which made me feel absolutely lost when i ended up choosing to live i decided to pursue the thing most similar to my dream career because if i wa going to live then i didnt care about ending up poor like everyone seems to think when i tell them i still do n't have an opinion or interest in a lot of thing because i try to only focus on what i like and thing that normally wouldnt end with someone attacking me for it now here 's the problem i have a friend who is very into politics is always trying to talk about it and doe n't like to admit what she 's saying might be wrong because of this a lot of time i feel like she or other people think i 'm dumb for not being interested in important thing like that or similar and it make me so mad because i 'm trying so hard to convince myself to live and they just see me like a weirdo for not caring about certain topic,1

i just want to throw some thought out there i could write them down in a journal or something but i do n't want to just dwell on them i want to think that maybe someone read them and really understood i do n't want sympathy or help right now i 'm not in danger of committing suicide and i have a good family that love and support me but i just want to release the thought i 've been keeping bottled up i 'm and my life is really just getting started but i feel like it 's already pointless when i have my worst depression moment i 'm overcome and crippled with apathy i have plan for my life i want to get a bachelor 's degree in communication become a writer of some kind or another marry the love of my life and be a mom but i feel stuck removed from time somehow i understand logically how going to class will get me to my bachelor 's degree how going to work will help me pay for said schooling how going to social activity and dating is what i need to do if i want to meet my perfect partner but even knowing all that i ca n't see how getting out of bed in the morning is going to change anything i 'm not crushed by despair i 'm just floating in a void of nothing i have so much to be grateful for and i am grateful but often i find myself feeling more guilty than grateful i 'm not doing anything to better humanity so do i really deserve to be happy i do n't mean to be prideful in saying so but i am very smart and a very good singer i have a lot of potential but since i do n't feel like i 'm living up to that potential i do n't feel like i deserve to have those talent last year i nearly failed all my class and almost lost my scholarship because i just could n't convince myself to get out of bed in the morning or put any effort into studying that 's not like me at all i graduated h with high honor and even some college credit i 've had some time away from school to get help from medication therapy and family most of the time i feel okay and i feel ready to go back to school and try again but there are moment like this one where i feel completely hopeless that evil little voice in my head not literally tell me that i had my chance and i blew it and i 'll never be able to finish college and i 'll never be able to get a job my best friend left month ago she 's living on the other side of the world teaching english and serving people in a third-world country it 's an amazing opportunity and i 'm really happy for her but i feel so alone i can email her but how can i tell her anything that happens in my life when she 's living in worse condition and doing greater work than i am and she 'll be there for another month i worry constantly that she 'll come home on a completely different level and we wo n't be able to connect anymore because she 'll be so much better of a person than me we 'll still be friend but before she left we were like sister i 've never had a lot of friend i have the mindset that quality is better than quantity it wa fine in high school but now that everyone ha left for college i feel lonely a lot two of my closest friend are my mom and my oldest brother since i moved back home recently i get to talk to them but they already have a lot going on and i feel bad relying on them to take all my emotional crap the middle brother in my family is facing huge health challenge and ha worse emotional problem than i do i want to confide in my mom and i want her comfort but i do n't want to stretch her thin between her kid and her own life my brother is a senior in high school so he 's constantly busy trying to survive but some thing i just ca n't talk to my brother about it 's too complicated and this post is already ridiculously long but my love life is pretty nonexistent too i want to date and get out there but guy just do n't seem interested i 'm at least average looking and i 'm a nice person sometimes i think that if i got a chance maybe someone would like me but then sometimes i think that no one would like me it feel impossible to find a guy that would want to deal with me for the rest of our life i feel a little better after typing this all so if you actually read all this thank you and i 'm sorry it 's just nice to let it all out tomorrow i 'll be a grownup again,1
update we are aware this person ha been pm-ing everyone who 's participated in this thread with claim that we are lying about their action i hope it go without saying that we 're not one of the people who let u know what they 're up to used the phrase persecution complex and the behaviour unfortunately doe seem to be consistent with that after warning and explanation they said they would cooperate then persisted in doing exactly what we told them wa against the rule after we resorted to banning the account something we very rarely do here they announced that they were going to escalate their rule-breaking behaviour the sort of person who claim to want to help but ignores a community 's rule while claiming to want to follow them is in our regretful opinion exactly the sort of person that our vulnerable ops need to be protected from if you received any pm a follow-up to a comment you made on this post please click report on all of them a this brings this person 's behaviour to the attention of the reddit admins thanks we 've had report of pm-ing behaviour from a serial religious proselytiser whom we 've had to take action against for persistently trying to save people in this sub their favourite tactic appears to be encouraging people to join a church because it 's a way to find a community this is a notorious evangelical recruitment tactic do n't fall for it edit i should have worded that last sentence better we 're not saying that all religion is notorious or anything we 're saying that this particular person is being deceptive and manipulative and misrepresenting themselves and their intention in a way that 's representative of the worst type of cultish religion so our issue is fundamentally not with religion but the misuse of it,1

tarot card for psychology interestingly enough i wa reading up on tarot card and the history of them first a playing card divination/spirit communication whatever you want to call it came later i think many people who do psychic reading just do it for the money if you actually think you re talking to spirit well you have another thing coming but whatever float your boat anyway i read that some therapist use them sort of like a rorschach test providing a different perspective of seeing a problem both figuratively and physically in the image granted thing only have power if you give it power but i still think it s an interesting idea,0
i ve been trying so hard lately to keep it together because i don t want to start downward spiraling and tonight it all kinda hit me at once i got home and couldn t stop thinking about how thing might be better if i didn t have such social anxiety or depression or how many time i ve missed chance because i m too scared i try not to think about this kinda thing but sometimes it s hard i wonder what i might be like if i could just have a normal functioning brain for a day it get to the point where i just feel absolutely drained physically and mentally when i begin to feel tear well up in my eye even though i didn t feel like crying- it s like my body last fed cry for help if that make sense and even though i tell myself it will be fine and continue to push through it there s that part of me that feel broken the part of me that want nothing more than to let it all out and cry to lock myself in my room all day i m not going to let myself do that again but man i can t begin to describe how terrible it feel,1

ca n't fill the void i feel like i 'm just wandering in the desert right now no sense of direction lost and suffering a little background i 'm year old and got out of a very toxic relationship a couple month back i 've history with mild drug abuse but have been clean for month now i quit my career in it just a few week ago because i 'm tired of sitting in front of a screen answering phone call with no fulfillment i have a fairly healthy physical lifestyle i run yoga climb and have a healthy diet i literally have no idea what to do i 'm emotional wreck from my breakup and the loneliness is unbearable my past relationship isolated me from majority of my friend and support network i have have a couple of month to find income again or i 'll be basically homeless this is some serious pain and i 've set myself up for a way where i can no longer escape from it i 'm trying to not go the self destructive way with drug or shit relationship but i feel backed into a corner and it 's crippling i should probably see a therapist but honestly do n't have insurance and ca n't afford one anyway i guess i just needed to vent i feel a little bit better after writing this out any suggestion thanks everyone danny,1

i 've been depressed for about a year now but i only realized what it wa a couple month after it started i 'm at that early high school age where people are n't quite mature and respectful so nobody really reach out to anyone i have always been quite mature for my age and that did n't cause problem until last year when i started to gain a reputation a somebody who argues too much if i get into a minor disagreement with somebody people will gang up on me and because i find myself to be surrounded by people who are not yet emotionally mature they do n't see the harm in this i do n't talk much anymore mainly because i 'm scared to be attacked and ostracized further i have always done very well in school but i have been falling behind in my class because i ca n't bring myself to voluntarily make myself do something i do n't enjoy a a result of my reputation a an arguer and a smart guy people frequently act like that 's all i am i became an atheist a bit more than a year ago and this definitely make me feel disconnected with the people at my school a there is very little diversity and there is an overwhelming catholic majority i play video game in my down time but while it is merely a hobby my parent feel that it is the reason i am depressed and they frequently try to talk to me about giving me strict time limit i started taking antidepressant at the beginning of this year and i have definitely noticed a very slight improvement i have n't seriously considered suicide but i have definitely felt strongly that i wish i could disappear from everything giving me grief and never worry about anything again i just hope maybe you guy can tell me something to help,1

i 'm helping i 've been helping a lady trailer loading her young very flighty horse i use clicker training rewarding every step in the right direction not prompting but letting the animal choose to move when it 's ready it is very different from traditional method which usually mean applying pressure with varying degree of force until the horse move in the right direction for context it 's a new technology and many horse people are very sceptical of it the dog world ha come a lot further and choose the tried and true aversion based method which in general work just fine i got no beef with it it 's just not great when there is fear and tension in the picture since the pressure can add to that tension being restrained or pushed when you 're scared will often increade that fear and scared animal are dangerous especially big one so the other day this horse with a history of rearing and throwing himself backwards to avoid being devoured by the black hole that is the trailer choose to walk calmly and happily straight into it without any prompt or guidence from u ear forward long stride he looked very pleased with himself i love seeing that what i really love though is how the owner change when they learn about reward based training they start out with a stubborn stupid or scared animal and end up with a smart eager and brave one the horse or dog is the same of course except for some different behaviour but the owner perception of them change and that tends to become a self fulfilling prophecy it 's just a shift of focus but it is everything instead of trying to get rid of the bad stuff we focus on the good stuff and make it grow until there is no room for bad stuff anymore btw tho attitude tends to spill over into other aspect of life which is amazing seeing owner beaming with pride smiling from ear to ear is just the best feeling in the world,0

after we dated for a while in high school she fell off my radar we made a couple attempt to rekindle a simple platonic friendship like we had before we dated but it just kept getting awkward my fault i still had really strong feeling for her that i could n't control and it wa best for both of u to recognize the awkwardness and go our separate way i 'm pretty confident i 'm over her she kept a really low profile throughout her 's but a couple year ago just sprung up out of the blue i got into pokemon go and looked up a local online chapter of player to meet with she wa running it i wa tempted to jump into a meet-up like hoh-bee-doh why won'tcha look'it all these pokemon player oh it 's you hi long time then we 'd strike up a conversation and catch up and see how the other wa doing but she know me too well she would know i 'd never actually go to one of those thing just to participate with a bunch of randos and then it would be awkward again possibly unraveling over a decade 's worth of personal growth so i decided eh this is satisfactory because it mean she 's doing well enough to put herself out there and organize a huge group of people in something she 's passionate about definitely doing a lot better socially than i am,0

doe anyone else feel a strong sense of bittersweetness when watching old movies/tv show where the actor were in their prime and then seeing them when they 're old like i 'm only so i wa n't even alive when friend started airing but i 'm only about five or so year away before i 'm around the age of some of the cast when the show began i mean the show ran for year that 's a lot of these actor 's life and now it 's been well over year since the show ended too i get a real feeling of both sadness but also something nice being able to see these people and other actor when they were young and then in the next few second being able to see them fairly old i think the feeling is amplified when you watch a show where the actor are playing people who are just living life because even though that life wa obviously not real it sorta seems like seeing a real person go through a part of life in the show,0

the fact that my life is n't that bad make me more depressed so i just tried to get on the suicide prevention online chat thing and while i wa waiting for it to like load or whatever i just thought to myself what even do i say is my problem like i go to one of the best college in the u i 'm in a fraternity all my family is alive i have a decent amount of money and yet i think about killing myself every day i 've already tried before and ended up in the hospital and then i come on here and it 's like my entire family wa murdered when i wa and i 've been on the street since then struggling with drug addiction and then i 'm just like fuck what the hell do i have to feel depressed about i just feel so alone i feel like my entire fraternity just pretend to be my friend a well a all my friend who are n't in my fraternity i have a best friend who i try and talk to about my problem and i 'm like yeah i have depression she 's like oh damn that suck anyway and change the subject i literally feel paranoid just walking around outside even tho i 'm a pound white dude i feel like i 'm losing my goddamn mind i want to get a dog so i can have someone who i know actually care about me but i do n't think i can because if i kill myself i dont know who 'd take care of it so i 'm in a weird situation there idk i 'm all over the place people would kill to be in my situation and here i am wasting my potential by wallowing in self pity all the fucking time which in turn make me more depressed i 'd kill myself right now but my mom and dad would be torn up and i ca n't do that to them i go see a therapist and everything but it doe n't help i just do n't even really know what to do anymore i 'm not a guy you 'd think would be mentally ill a fuck at first glance so it 's kind of hard to bring up to people especially when you do n't trust them because you think they 're pretending to be your friend idk how do i cope w wanting to kill myself every time i wake up,1
i 'm still young yr old but i 'm at the stage where i thought i would be developing my skill and connection a well a having experience that enrich my life and influence my world view but i feel like anything close to a normal development is completely out of reach i did n't have a single friend throughout all of grade school i did n't even really graduate high school and overall i 'm just scrambling to get my life together right now i 'm furiously studying math to get into a top phd program and it seems like that 's the only thing that i could possibly be spending my time and energy on because my late start at even being a functioning member of society doe n't afford me the privilege of making friend having fun and knowing what it 's like to be a part of any social circle at all socializing is a struggle feeling confident enough to believe that someone will accept me is a struggle and i do believe that if i work hard at those thing i 'll be able to overcome these challenge but the problem is that i ca n't i have other thing to do early on i missed out on nearly everything important and now i feel like i 'm paying the price by ironically being forced to narrow my option down even further but i 'm burned out beyond measure my mind need a rest i 'm in a state of constant stress and i never get to talk to anyone about it i feel like my default state of mind is feeling constant despair and hopelessness at the hand of the universe the earth the people around me my field of study and everything that 's too big for my tiny mind to comprehend my blood pressure is always up i 'm always on high alert every little thought give me anxiety about every possible step in my future i regularly wake up in the middle of the night in cold sweat gasping for air i do n't even know why i study anymore it 's almost purely mechanical i do n't derive joy from anything i ca n't think of one thing that brings me any sort of pleasure i have n't played a video game in year because i find them to be tedious chore i do n't enjoy movie except a distraction but for some reason i keep chugging along in my singular potentially meaningless pursuit that i think will magically bring value to my life i 'm actually expecting to go through the whole ordeal alone isolate myself after it 's all over and end up dying alone why wa i born i did n't enjoy this life what am i even doing why am i even bothering to do anything at all what kind of worth do i even have what kind of worth will i find in myself by doing the thing i do who will be there for me through all of it i do n't have answer to those question and if i do n't find a satisfactory answer soon enough i do n't know where i 'll find the motivation to continue living,1

go on vacation with your friend that may sound stupid or silly but honestly it a really friendship cementing thing and prepares you for adult hood,0
when one of my friend asked me to explain how it feel i wa at a loss for word at first but then i remembered that we both like video game and tried it like this thought i 'd share it maybe people can relate to it edit thank you all so much it mean a lot to me that it mean a lot to you okay imagine you 're playing an rpg and you 've been going through the most hellish dungeon ever you 've been unprepared underleveled and barely survived then at the end you find one of the most awesome piece of loot ever it 's called the cape of depression it 's completely op putting it on would give you immunity to nearly everything the game can throw at you sure there are some negative stats on it too but those seem managable you put it on and it 's a awesome a you thought it would be nothing can harm you it doe n't deflect or defend you against attack they simply pas through you nothing can touch you anymore sword arrow fireball doe n't matter it 's all the same to you because you simply dont feel it anymore for some time you feel like a god you glide through the mass and it 's exhilerating nobody can touch you you 're completely free but the cape ha disadvantage it doe n't just let attack pas through you but also any blessing healing spell and potion sure it 's a bit inconvenient at first but you 'll manage after all nobody can hurt you anymore so you dont need these kind of thing anymore actually you dont even miss them anymore since you put on the cape everything ha felt the same anyway and those sign of affection dont have any practical purpose to you anymore so why bother so you continue with your quest wrapped in the cape but somehow it doe n't feel the same anymore nobody can hurt you anymore so you walk right through your enemy not bothering to fight nobody can heal or comfort you anymore so you walk right through your ally too not bothering to talk it 's just you and the cape it 's starting to get boring so you think about trying it without the cape but a you try to take it off you look down at yourself and realize that you 're still carrying the very same injury you got in the dungeon in which you found the cape they never healed but you never got any more either then you remember how difficult and dangerous it wa without the cape it 's easy to remember too after all you have those injury to prove your point you need the cape so you decide to leave it on at some point thing just happen around you without you taking notice anymore nothing can affect you neither good or bad so why bother you 're truly like a god now but not in the grand majestic kind of way you are simply not in touch both literally and metaphorically with the normal people around you anymore maybe you 're mildly confused and irritated by them why do they act like they do what 's the point you dont want to feel left out like a freak so you pretend to still be in touch with them the cape help you it grant you a to acting and deceiving when talking about yourself and you need that buff because if someone would come to close to you touch you they would see that they pas right through you and realize something is very very wrong you dont want that so you stay away from others which in turn make you even more distant by the time you 've realized that the cape wa cursed it 's already too late it ha become a part of you it 's wrapped around you around your true self you are still somewhere inside but around your true self is that vast cloak of nothing that keep any feeling no matter if good or bad out you 've worn the cape for so long that you have forgotten how it feel to feel when you go to your ally and ask for help they dont see what the cape ha done to you they only see the old wound and think you must be in pain they cast their healing spell on you but they pas right through you however all they see is that those old wound just wont heal so they get frustrated and give up it 's just you and the cape edit oh and i while this wa not in my original explanation i feel that this should definately be in though some of the worst day are those when the cape randomly shift your alignment to neutral evil suddenly you can feel again but the cape allows you only one single feeling anger you 're angry at the cape for having so much power over you you 're angry at yourself for letting it happen and you 're angry at your enemy and ally alike you start to remember every single time insult and injury from the small goblin that threw rock at you all the way up to the lich sending wave after wave of mindless undead after you you remember every single time your tank failed to protect you every single healing spell cast just a second too late suddenly you 're the fickle god again looking down on the mass with a smile of disdain on your face for a moment you 're glad you feel and then the next day it 's over the cape ha worked it curse again only to leave you ashamed and guilty for being cruel to your ally and vindictive towards your enemy but fear not the cape is still there wrapping you in nothing that protects you from nothing,1

in the august of i wa at one of my lowest point i wa struggling with suicidal thought daily i lost the will to do anything because i thought i had no one to please i wa struggling with overeating and wa overweight then i did something that changed my life i gave myself six month to see if thing would get better and if they did n't i would kill myself because i could n't take it anymore first i tried to change my state of mind i began to try to think more positively i tried to be nicer to people i met new people and quickly gained a reputation a being that quiet but really nice guy the people i met during this time would have never known i had depression i joked with them i smiled around them the funny thing is a time went on this smile became le of a facade and became more genuine i finally found some people who actually cared and that wa huge i started exercising i met a lot of these people through my cross-country team i spent le time eating because i had more thing to do and a my state of mind improved i found it easier to find the will to do thing and lost weight which i 've kept off for three month now i 'm now at a healthy weight bmi of and feel so much better than i did weighing twenty pound more i got clean i used to self-harm nearly daily i wa not in a good place part of it wa probably due to the people i found and the support that came with it but i will say today 's a big milestone for me i have n't self-harmed since i am proud to be able to truthfully say i am now six month clean another thing i noticed changing were my social skill i wa quiet because i had no confidence in myself around other people i will say that taking the first step to meet someone new is tough but figured they probably did n't know much about me i could be someone other than the emptiness i felt inside a time passed conversation flowed much easier i spent le time trying to say the right thing and more time just talking needle to say my confidence improved greatly especially a the weight came off we 're all fighting a really tough battle but you 're never going to improve if you do n't give yourself to opportunity to do so it 's not going to be easy but start with something simple like maybe taking better care of yourself or improving your behavior around other people then gradually shift to more daunting problem like your outlook on event the thing is once you improve yourself in one of these area it becomes easier to improve the others maybe give yourself six month like i did a hell of a lot can change in six month give yourself a try at time it 's not going to be easy but you can do it you can turn this around and i 'll be here for support a well what helped me wa finding the right people and if there 's no one else i 'll be that person in the august of i gave myself six month to see if thing would get better and if they did n't i would kill myself today start month number seven,1

lsd trip are very personal depending on what skeleton are in your closet and how you truly feel about yourself deep down inside the trip will vary you can not hide from the truth on acid if you 're in the prime of your life and have no worry it a deep opportunity to get to know yourself even better if you 've been suppressing thought they will come out the onset of a trip brings butterfly it like waiting in line for a rollercoaster once it hit you a wave of euphoria coupled with a oneness and a feeling on connection with your surroundings inanimate object are imbued with energy everything breathes and ha life time and space are warped a moment can seem to last forever small thing can seem huge shadow breathe light refracts and your sense of physical self can become hyper aware or completely disconnected you may feel like you 're helpless you may need the people around you to help you just walk outside a trip to the store is like an epic journey trying to tell the time or count money is impossible.you may pay for a can of soda then take a sip and feel every bubble going thru your whole body your laughter will roll into tear and your sweat runny nose and tear will mix into one you may come to a realization that will stick with you for a very long time afterwards if you 're lucky some deep thought and self reflection will give you perspective on yourself that you may never have another opportunity to understand so deeply smoking weed and drinking beer will feel even more amazing if you take the time to just stare at a painting or even a blank wall or something with some texture allow your eye to relax and start experiencing the wave of energy that have always been there but you could n't perceive unless you did hour upon hour of meditation there is something all around u at all time that it can be difficult to perceive but on acid the other realm and dimension that we exist in become easier to feel the comedown is light and slow take the time during your comedown to reflect even more smoke some weed ride out the final wave listen to music play music pink floyd wa always my favorite the next day feel like you 're a little emotionally drained but cleansed at the same time it usually a good feeling maybe a little hazy maybe a little melancholy but usually feel like the first day to the rest of your life lsd is an important part of growing up finding yourself and opening your mind it not supposed to be used just to get high it a spiritual thing x200b /u/ huphelmeye http //www.reddit.com/user/huphelmeyer r x200b that pretty much sum my experience with acid a well i 've done it maybe time with dos varying from mics be respectful of the dosage 100ug is completely different from 150ug the potency is exponential when it come to lsd do it in a familiar environment have planned activity i usually listen to music snack on fruit and powerade outside is where it at tho go biking walking etc you become god like at sport and video game you are always move ahead it crazy,0

sigh it not like me to be anxious i 'm the archetypal type-b go with the flow personality and have n't had a legitimate mental breakdown in year that changed today without giving too much away i 'm an american college student in a rigorous dual major stem course that is constantly leaving me out of my element i struggle to get good grade that is even more stressful when i have a grade determined scholarship that i am now on probation for more anxiety today i sat down in what i thought wa my easiest class to get a test back the professor had posted what the highest average and lowest grade were in a class of about i thought it wa an easy test sure there were a few thing i did n't know when i took it but that 's fine right i had the lowest grade in the class i walked home in the light rain about a mile to finish formatting a lab report to turn in in the afternoon and study for a test on tuesday the lab report needed way more work than me or my group thought and i did n't get the time to study i wanted more anxiety more stress i went to lab in the rain another mile it doe bear mentioning that i have never considered myself socially anxious or awkward but i like all people want to feel helpful in a group hence my work on the report turned in the report and got to work in the lab wa n't helpful did n't screw anything up but did n't help much either feeling of inadequacy i got home and studied for a few hour made dinner then got a call from my family a call i 've been avoiding for about a week after my mom and i got in a fight i answered it should n't have suffered through a minute call let her hang up then i sat and stared blankly at my sleeping computer trying to get back to work like i had been before the call i broke i have n't had a real mental breakdown in almost year tear needing to lie down fatigue emotion compound that with anxiety and a literal need to perform to keep my scholarship and it wa the perfect synthesis reaction for panic it gone now empty put on some classical guitar i normally listen to in order to help study empty the deafening silence of strumming from phone speaker and an airconditioning unit i 'm a creative person story entertainment mask i build story around myself to entertain i 'll address a table of friend have i ever told the story of the time i_____________________ pas the time fill in the silence make a mask bury emotion seem perfect even my subconscious way of writing contrasting sticatto short sentence with flowing runons of text is my natural writing built on my experience of literature compounded on my past in acting and creative storytelling my mind wanders and i do not think i will even bother to read the top of this at the end of stream of consciousness that flow like a river from my mind to my hand to the screen carried across neuron to axon to tendon to muscle to bone to button to wire to signal at the speed of light in far more complexity than i could ever dream of understanding and i am become insignificant and in the end i feel better i guess i hope i need i hunger better i guess writing help back into the fray of benzene derivative and non-homogenous differential equation a i prepare for another two test the one place my mask cant protect me slicing like scalpel through emotional barrier and sinew of facade forcing out fact and my own lack of insight into written form i cant even bluff my way out like an humanity course i will be right or i will be wrong and i will be wrong anxiety press like a blanket of ice and rusted screw chill and probing friend offer respite from the voice entertainment drowns them out but eventually the casual table break up the battery dy and the chill return it is still raining outside not posted here before did i say that should i why would i scroll up past this broken line of prose buried so far underneath black and white pixel that convey information shouted into a void hoping for an answer wanting an answer hungering for an answer and then i think of all there is to experience in the world in the natural and in the study of the natural and scientific to wonder at biology with childlike enthusiasm or to stare at the star like gallileo of old and realize my place in that i find comfort though it is raining and i can not see the sky through the plaster above me the strumming of guitar mingle with the rain a the hour of test draw closer my mind clear fragment connect into flow ceaseless and without separation a normality return with it lack of natural division beyond what is imposed by the self the same self devoted to

so i 've been pretty busy and distracted recently trying to find a job before we run out of money for rent and bill keeping motivated to exercise aswell a trying to help my parent who have both been ill recently thought i wa doing well and actually keeping in a pretty good mood and headspace considering everything seeming to happen at once but no i forgot to order my prescription of citalopram last week it 's ordered now but might take a few more day i think i might be getting some withdrawal symptom but i just feel generally rubbish so maybe i just have a cold i do n't really know how long it take to get withdrawal i usually take 40mg i tapered out my last few so i had a 20mg a day for a few day but i have n't had one since sat any advice on how to ease the symptom my main problem is a very annoying persistent headache but i 'm also feeling sick in my stomach not sure if i should eat anything too much,1
i believe we should all have the right to choose suicide i believe suicide should be a human right of the same importance a food and shelter in a world where we are all repeatedly told how 'free we are to do whatever we want we are denied the freedom to choose whether we want to live that life or not every person should have the right to choose medically assisted suicide it is nobody else 's business to interfere with this person 's choice least of all the government i have a major problem with involuntary psychiatric treatment a psychiatric hospital is no more a hospital than a prison 'patients have not committed a crime yet are unable to leave and are forced to take medication these people are being denied their freedom despite not being guilty of a criminal offence doing this 'for their own good is immoral and unjustified who do these people think that are to decide what is best for another adult it 's a show of arrogance and ignorance a no man can say what is best for another against their will if a man with terminal cancer can refuse treatment he should also be able to refuse psychiatric treatment it is wrong to say that a suicidal person is not thinking rationally and would regret their decision to commit suicide it is not up to anyone else to determine the rationality of another 's thought on this matter while i agree some people who survived a suicide attempt are glad they did many others regret failing or not attempting or would tell you they were happy to not be here anymore if they could rant over i 'd like to hear some other thought on this,1

beyond tired of pretending that i m ok. sorry for the long post this is my first reddit post and i don t really know how to say all this i am year old and i ve struggled with suicidal thought and depression since i wa around year old i ve been on medication since i wa and been doing therapy for many year it help a bit but in all honesty it s not making a huge difference most of my friend and family think that my depression is just kinda like a sad mood that happens they don t realize that i fantasize about dying daily the only thing keeping me alive is that i know that my death would break the spirit of my friend and family which sound narcissistic now that i say it like i m that important my two best friend in the world know that i struggle to stay alive and they both are always there for me when i need it the problem is that i feel like i am not worth their time or anybody s time for that matter i feel like i m always bugging them even though they assure me i m not i feel like i m always needing attention and reassurance that people care for me i just feel so damn needy and i hate it i am in love with one of my best friend and we have talked about it and she said that she did have feeling for me but that it would be best if we just stayed friend which honestly is ok. i don t think i am worthy of her anyways and i love her too much to risk losing her friendship and i also made her a promise that i would always be there for her essentially i told her one time that i had tried to kill myself and a i told her i realized how much pain it would cause so i promised that i wouldn t ever leave her here s my problem i desperately just want to be happy for real i can t stand faking it anymore i want to die because trying to struggle through this is too much to bear it feel like i m fighting another version of myself who just want to end it every second of every day i don t know what to do thanks for listening,1

suicidal relationship breakdown i guess this is a scream for help my partner/ex-partner is asleep in bed next to me week ago she told me she want to leave me we live together and there 's been no argument cheating abuse anything like that she say she love me but just is n't in love with me anymore that her schedule an insanely intensive postgraduate programme that regularly see her busy or six day a week ha left her not having the headspace for anything else i admittedly overcompensated for the feeling of distance this term and have got too clingy and anxious about wanting attention and time from her we 've been talking around and around for a month we had a week apart and she 's abroad for month solid on her programme at the end of this coming week when she return she want to move out we live in an expensive city i will lose her and my home that we worked so hard to build i would be reduced to living with total stranger in room i can barely afford again back to square one but the real point is losing her i do n't care that it 's a cliché she is everything to me and i can not ever replace her i intend to kill myself if she still doe n't want me after having those two month away i have calculated everything i would need to do it and intend to use method at once to ensure success i 've written a will advance decision but i need to figure out someone to witness the signing that wo n't give it away and letter to everyone but her i 'll get to that last i 'll be dead in our garage with instruction on our bed for her to call emergency service to collect me but not go in and not touch anything but her letter so a to not get her dna on anything i do n't know if i 'm asking for anything i do n't want to die but living without her is more than i choose to so i 'm already seeing a counsellor but that doe n't solve the actual problem i guess doe anyone want to tell me anything or ask me anything,1

did anyone else have a hobby they enjoyed when you were younger but ended up dropping it for one reason or another and are trying to get back into it at the present i 'm and in my last year of university studying history at the moment but despite my long post i love history still and hopefully if i make it through i 'll start my pgce yet when i wa younger during secondary school i used to love drawing though i wa n't great yet what put me off pursing it further wa when i asked the art teacher if based on my drawing i could pick the art course a a option and she flat out said my art wa n't good enough to do that after that i just gradually lost motivation to draw which in the end wa on me a i could have kept trying to improve on my own but that hit my hard at the time only this year i 've been trying to get back into the swing of drawing again although it 's pretty awful naturally after not drawing in year and i do n't have a much time to work on it to be honest what brought this post on wa the fact that i see lot of drawing post on different sub reddits about how they have practised over the year when they were younger and are now great which is only natural but i do n't often see many post about people who started or restarted late with a hobby doe n't have to be drawing but anyone else people trying to get back into a hobby they gave up when they were younger how are you finding it once gain apology for this long post/ramble i do n't usually post topic in general but wa just kinda curious about anyone else trying to get back into old hobby and how it 's going,0

so i posted on here about a year ago on a different account and i got a heck of a lot of support and help and right now feel like a good time to put myself out there again i spent the last nine month in rehab so i ve been clean off of everything for almost now and for a while that wa enough to keep me happy but i screwed myself up pretty bad before i got clean a suicide attempt left me with pretty bad frostbite scar all over the lower half of my body and a much a i want to be objective and say that beauty is on the inside it s hard to feel like i ll ever be loved enough to top it off i ve got alopecia so i wear wig because my hair think growing is overrated i keep thinking if somebody had the option to choose between me and a girl with hair without scar everywhere they d choose the other girl because it s just easier and better that way i know the only way to move on from this is to accept it somehow but i don t understand how i m supposed to be okay with it i like who i am inside but the outside make me want to stay in bed for hour and hour and never let anybody look at me again i guess i m just confused a hell i m sober i m doing better than i have in a long time but suddenly the self hate went up a thousand notch i don t see my therapist for another two day so i guess what i m looking for is some feedback to help me see thing more objectively here because i don t really know what i should do but the worse it get the more scared i am of doing something stupid like relapsing i know now that it s the last thing i want but when i panic or get depressed it seems like a great idea i m just rambling at this point i m gunna end it here,1

it 's been day since it happened we were having dinner at her dorm room some nice slow cooked chicken with mustard then we went for a smoke break and had a casual chat about nothing when out of the blue she almost casually said we should break up at first i thought it wa a joke and answered laughingly sure of course we should that 's what all people do eventually might a well do it now she did n't laugh we started dating around late october it 's hard to point out the exact date since it took u couple of week to figure out what it wa that we were doing i wa deeply depressed back then after another painful break-up that turned out to be extremely important to this new relationship the new girl wa in an abusive relationship at the time so we both had our fair share of skeleton in our closet we could talk for day without getting tired of each other and when we needed time to think we just listened to the music luckily our taste were almost identical i quickly grew quite fond of her and at one of those romantic moment mastered enough courage to ask what she thought about u it took her a week to answer that question in the meantime we stayed very close friend one day she came to my dorm in the evening after a fight with her boyfriend and we kissed she then cried in my arm the next day she broke up with that guy and we became a couple she never told joke so i should have realized right away that she wa n't joking about a breakup but i just could n't believe it that last time in september left me so traumatized that i entered something of an autopilot mode she told me that i became a close friend to her that she doe n't want to lose me that we can still talk blah blah blah all the usual lie and i wa naive enough to believe them once again all i could do wa nod i had no strength to do anything else but besides the default stuff she told me something else something that cut much deeper than i first thought it would she wa tired of me tired of my gloomy mood tired of the music i listened to tired of the thing i talked about tired of the movie i watched tired of being around me but most of all tired of helping me she could talk and talk about her ex all the way they had wronged her all the way she had wronged them i wa more than happy to talk to her about that it felt very refreshing to have someone who wa not afraid to share the deepest secret with me and i wa not afraid to share mine with her that wa a mistake after some time her wound began healing i don t know how much of that wa due to our little chat but there it wa more and more when we met she would ask me why are you so sour ha something happened cheer up and frankly i didn t know why i wa gloomy sometimes i would just wake up and realize i didn t want to get out the bed but then i would remember her and force myself up i still felt like a worthless piece of shit but at least there wa someone who didn t think so about me i felt good if only sometimes we were helping each other she got better i did not so that s why she decided to break up she didn t need me anymore oh but how she talked about what great friend we are how our friendship must continue how she wished me only the best that turned out to be a lie i came to her a couple of time afterward tried talking to her tried but with each visit i became more and more frustrated angry even not once ha she reached out to me not once ha she partied with our mutual friend without me knowing about it not one of them would so much a look in my direction i should have expected it the same thing happened to me before although i wasn t a persistent at trying to keep the friendship going then but i tried in never work but i wanted so hard to talk to her just talk i wanted to talk to anyone but no one wa there i begin to feel better now bit by bit although it s still excruciatingly painful to see her especially happy i know it s cruel and uncalled for and i should be glad that she is happy but all i can feel is pain guilt and most of all disappointment i should have known better but some never learn i suppose sorry for this excessively long rant i just wanted to get this off my chest writing your thought out help or so they say it s not even half the story but that probably wouldn t even fit in a post and i haven t processed everything yet thank you for reading this far it mean a lot to me,1

not /u/maiqtheliarr but i agree with him/her so i 'll share my own perspective for the record i enjoy disney movie i 'll even watch and enjoy new one when i 'm in the mood for a feel-good fun movie but i know a couple people that regularly rewatch disney movie i do n't care but i could n't date somebody like that it just strike me a juvenile there 's nothing inherently wrong with liking thing that are marketed to kid like amusement park or harry potter or disney but when that is your main source of entertainment it 's a bit pathetic i realize this sound pretentious but i ca n't understand why those people do n't want to watch film consume art that is more interesting/challenging/thought-provoking/etc just to clarify i 'm not saying that everybody need to watch high brow film all the time or else they 're uncultured pleb i fuck with the lion king a much a anyone i 'm just saying that when people 's favourite movie are the lion king or something i feel like it implies that they do n't like thought-provoking art which again is fine in and of itself but can also be a relationship incompatibility to use an analogy i think everyone here would understand why somebody would n't want to date someone who regularly listens to kidz bop track it 's not that it 's morally wrong or anything it 's just weird,0
tdlr how to give myself a way to stay motivated and become a better human being x200b one would think that becoming a good human being is essentially motivation in and of itself the biggest struggle in my life ha mostly been derived from the inability to care enough to put the appropriate amount of effort in at this point even when i do try the fail part of it just seems inevitable i have let down friend my significant other which i do n't think will be staying with me anymore because of some of the terrible shit i 've done and i 've let down my family which thought better of me i know that i would rather not die but i 've subconsciously selected something not so terrible i 've given up and have turned off emotion and motivation to just do nothing x200b to be more specific i have not had the motivation to perform well at any of the job i 've held i did not do well in the college course i took and subsequently did not find much employment in it i have failed to be useful and good for my friend or to even wish good thing for them in the end only caring about myself then again with my girlfriend i only managed to think about myself above all and rarely consider her feeling she talk about leaving me one and a while maybe tonight it is for sure if it matter i flirted with other woman and so i deserve that hit to my life i did n't deserve her to begin with x200b so life ha become an endless cycle of distraction video game are n't a break or leisure time they 're just to make time go by a little faster and god do i ever love getting to bed time i love sleep and probably go for hour every night perhaps talking to my girlfriend wa n't to know her better and develop our relationship it wa just to keep me happy a if that wa the only thing that mattered a if i 'm somehow the fucking victim in it all that i somehow just deserved it for being me that i did n't have to put effort in to be worth it i know that the truth is i still love her but i do n't think that matter now i know i care for her immensely more than i 've cared about anything else before seems like i 'm toxic for her so a part of me is happy if she leaf and doe better for herself x200b on the bright side maybe there 's a way out of the cycle i know there are option i could go back to school or get some sort of mental help i do n't know do thing to offset all this the problem is if not video game then what when do i start feeling like i 'm heading somewhere instead of nowhere what 's there to do in my daily life to feel like i 'm not melting perhaps all this is excuse but i live in a bumfuck nowhere town i have one friend and a few online one it cold outside currently otherwise i 'd go for stroll or something x200b what i said before summed it up well i 've given up and have turned off all emotion and motivation so that i could be le hurt by my failure and travesty but also le happy and thankful when i stumble upon amazing thing just like my sweet ex-girlfriend so how doe one mentally turn the switch back on do i have to get in a better place first if so how am i supposed to be motivated to do so in the current state i 'm in is this just the way i am now i know it stupid but a part of me feel like she 'll be okay with me again if i figure some path out to guarantee i 'm better and deserving she 's not a snob she doe n't think she 's too good she just ca n't cope with what i 've done x200b sorry for ranting and thanks for reading,1

so yesterday i had a post talking about people saying suicide is selfish just like the title suggests think twice before opening your mouth i honestly believe when people spread their ignorence around this topic it will do the greatest harm there is a stigma around any mental health issue and because of this people needing help wo n't reach out they will feel the guilt and feel blamed before you say anything to someone who is hurting deep down you should do some research it could save their life someone sent me this quote and i could n't agree more with it david foster wallace once said the so-called psychotically depressed person who try to kill herself doe n't do so out of quote hopelessness or any abstract conviction that life 's asset and debit do not square and surely not because death seems suddenly appealing the person in whom it invisible agony reach a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise make no mistake about people who leap from burning window their terror of falling from a great height is still just a great a it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view i.e the fear of falling remains a constant the variable here is the other terror the fire 's flame when the flame get close enough falling to death becomes the slightly le terrible of two terror it 's not desiring the fall it 's terror of the flame yet nobody down on the sidewalk looking up and yelling don t and hang on can understand the jump not really you 'd have to have personally been trapped and felt flame to really understand a terror way beyond falling,1

few month ago i lost contact with a friend of mine that i consider very dear to me essentially it wa my fault still even knowing that i 've done wrong i fell into a deep depression i felt sick could n't eat could n't sleep properly i constantly felt anxious i did n't really have anyone else it pushed me to try and befriend other people but even if i have these few people i can talk to now i feel so lonely without my friend lately it 's been driving me crazy i tried reaching out to my friend but it wa for naught this made me have even more paranoid thought what if they just talked to me out of pity what if they hate me will ever have the chance to talk to them again i 'm still holding onto a hope that maybe they 'll listen to me eventually because i need to explain myself and apologize properly but currently i 'm in such a dark place in the past i 've faced nothing but betrayal from others i grew to mistrust people i grew cold to people perhaps even to the point where i became apathetic towards others i did n't really show it i just would n't respond whenever talked to did n't feel like bothering with their nonsense my social anxiety also made and make it hard for me to speak to people now i 'm just afraid i do n't have the same view of human i had before however i still fear i 'm afraid of rejection i 'm afraid to make mistake i 'm afraid that i wo n't be understood lately i 've felt like nothing really matter anymore i do n't know if they are truly gone but their ignorance of me is so painful i know i do n't deserve good treatment but i just wanted a chance to fix thing i 've never bothered before i 've never even been in a situation like this before i 'm so lost and confused i 've even considered suicide because i feel like i screwed everything up that it 's over they hate me i did wrong to them a wrong that i 'm still not quite sure what it wa but i clearly did something i 'm afraid and alone it 's like without them there 's simply no point i swore if i somehow hurt them i would n't be able to forgive myself i do n't know what to do my loneliness is literally killing me,1

think about it here we are with this super powerful brain that allows u to be fully present in this cruel dark world i 'm assuming the more complicated a brain is the more thing that could possibly go wrong just like a machine i 'm no scientist but i 'd be willing to bet that since our brain are so much more complicated than other specie we have more potential mental illness seems obvious to me we tend to view ourselves a superior to le intelligent specie but are we really a cat ha only a few thing on it mind that it ha to worry about food water sleep shelter defecate pee and reproduce we have these in addition to ton of other thing that we have to worry about every second while we 're awake i had to take an online training class at my college and it said that if you were ever going to do an experiment and you could do it with both mouse and dog perfectly well then you should choose mouse because they are le sentient they are not able to perceive the full pain of the world even when it is right there in from of them not saying they do n't feel pain i 'm just saying they are n't able to perceive it a much a we would we could look in the future to see if this pain would persist our memory would remember the pain etc you could argue that we make more of a contribution to the world because of what we can do with our intelligence but doe it matter everything that wa ever done by human wo n't matter one day because everything will be gone so why the fuck doe it matter what we do i 'd rather be a cat and not be so aware of how little the world ha to offer and the pain and misery that billion of people have to face every single day,1

doe anybody remember mp3den.com i think they were active from late through to but i guess that wa just when i noticed they were gone i remember back in i used to go on there to snag song and burn them to disc so i could play them in the car when my mom drove me to school my friend wanted in on it so i started burning disc for them too i charged them two buck for an album so i wasn t just throwing my money out but for real though doe anybody remember this site at all i remember the site looking two different way the first one had to have been around it wa stark white and there wa a lot of content on screen i believe the main thing on the page wa song the staff picked to be on the front page later on around the site got a bit more dark and modern lot of red and black which reflected the time period well enough considering that wa the whole emo revival era the update were always fun to look forward to but a time went on they got pretty weird one of the owner there were five made update telling u what artist and album he planned to upload to the site i assume he wa buying physical copy and then ripping them to his computer but i think he made an update saying he wa ending that service he said it wa to make it more mysterious and to keep u on our toe but i think it wa because he wasn t buying cd a much anymore i remember that one of owner of the site always got strangely personal with his post often telling u home detail that were sort of tmi a time went on the update got sort of infrequent and shorter eventually it just came down to change he had in mind that he d express in one word sentence sorta bullet point style i think we started pissing off the main guy who updated by badgering him about the watermark on every single song like seriously who doe that he did and it wa always a hassle to cut it out before putting it onto disc lot of user didn t have the technical knowhow to splice it out but the guy insisted it wa important on keeping the intellectual integrity of the site ironic considering it wa bootlegging right i wa young back then so i definitely didn t know how to remove them eventually i learned to more or le drown them out and i m sure those cd i made if any of them are still around are riddled with that stupid shitty techno watermark i swear it s almost ingrained in my mind nearly year later it said www.mp3den.com experience it a i recall the voice wa strange and it wa pretty obvious that it wa pitch shifted down it also wasn t professional at all and it wa pretty obvious it wa one of the owner who made it i m sure if you look hard enough you could find song on youtube with that same exact watermark if you do let me know the forum were always fun i made a few friend on there i became close friend with one of the owner he wa always really chill occasionally you d have the people coming along and calling heresy on the whole site shouting about how bootlegging wa illegal but they got banned pretty quickly you d also have some guy trying to advertise their own mp3 site but they never got much attention i remember a few time there were guy who wanted to put their own music onto the site and they immediately stopped responding once one of the owner pointed out that they wouldn t be getting any royalty from it one guy went so far a to make a many fake account a possible and spam the forum hating the site but they all got banned and eventually he got tired of it looking back on all this the site seemed shady a hell but i certainly had a lot of fun on it i d really appreciate it if anyone could give me more info or even their possible memory of the site,0

suicide doe seem like a relief i used to have suicidal thought because i could n't be straight when i wa a teenager i discovered later on that the constant low-mood status i wa in is called depression i 'm in my early 20 and i still have suicidal thought i have lost my appetite most of the time i used to be passionate about my major living in an islamic country while being gay _and_ atheist kill part of me every day and the fact that i 'm not doing well in university make it hopeless for me to get out i feel like i 'm in a well-sealed box chocking and the only way to end my suffering is death,1

i m a toxic person i am diagnosed with bpd and am currently in therapy that feels/felt like i wa getting somewhere for the first time in forever my closest friend is my ex and he s very supportive in my recovery even though towards the end of our relationship i hurt him deeply and often something i m still remorseful about to this day among those thing were issue i caused within his friendship group due to me splitting and seeing those people a against me i know i wa wrong even though those feeling felt rational at the time but he worry i ll never get along with them and i don t see the point in trying to when they already dislike me we had a huge argument about it last night because i said i didn t regret acting on my feeling only the fallout which isn t true because i regret both but it s hard for me to admit i m wrong when i feel attacked the reason this matter is because we both had planned to be with each other again in the future but i feel like now i ve ruined everything he told me last night i haven t changed which hurt because i feel like i ve been doing so much better and communicating better and not acting on impulse i just made a mistake last night i hate hurting the people i love and i know they will be better off without me because i m toxic and manipulative and i don t think i ll ever recover suicide is almost an act of kindness when it come to me it s like putting an animal down so it can t hurt anyone else i have pill but not enough to be fatal in the past what stopped me wa not wanting to traumatise someone by jumping in front of a train or jumping from a building and i m sorry if i do but i need the guarantee that i will not wake up my mother life in a high rise with fire escape i m going to her house tomorrow for a family event and i ll be staying the night and in the early hour of the morning i ll take the codeine i have and jump hopefully i ll be so high i won t feel the fear or the pain a my body hit the ground i don t know how to say goodbye to the people i m leaving behind but i think it s best if i don t because they will only try to stop me like they have in the past and this time i can t fail,1

i have about a week before i get my first tattoo and i want to make sure it s the right thing i ve always held off because i don t want to get a tattoo that i regret but recently it came to me that there s two thing i will always stand for and i may a well get a tattoo based on them if i m going to get one i m almost and i m pretty sure this is what i want to do it s a half sleeve so i know for sure what i m getting the first session but i m still undecided about what i want to add the second session so i m still thinking on that part i m the kind of person that tends to overthink thing so i ob about one thing at a time and won t stop thinking about it until i know i m going to do it the right way basically i don t like to screw up also i ve researched tattoo online and one thing that scare me is that apparently some tattoo ink can get absorbed into your lymph node there s no known side effect of this but so many people have one and i never hear of any issue regarding this so i don t know how to feel about that most people would probably just say hey i want this tattoo and go get it but i can t do that i need to know this is the right thing and i don t have anyone who will talk with me about this without thinking i m a weirdo,0
lsd shrooms or something to that effect psychedelics don t open any portal to alien dimension nor expose you to unknown knowledge they do however allow oneself to observe their own existence from an as-removed-as-possible viewpoint little or big truth about yourself that you don t want to accept can not be hidden from and they are easy to accept when on a head full of shrooms it s not magic it is only a drug but it s a magical drug that can do wonder for you and change the way you perceive the world and the people in it if you medically can safely do it no family history of mental disorder i would absolutely recommend trying it of an ounce of shrooms or one tab of acid is a great starting position but always test your stuff,0

i don t really want to die i just want my old life back i had year of a painful injury followed by a procedure that in my opinion deformed my body i feel disgusted by the change to my body all the time and i have lost the ability to do the thing i loved i used to be happy and active now i m depressed anxious and barely functional i have been this bad for year i don t want to be like this anymore and i don t see it getting better unless my body magically go back to normal my friend either don t know or don t understand how serious it is most of them left me long ago when i stopped being my normal self my sleep is the worst i lie awake for hour with a racing heart i get almost like flash back but not of the trauma rather just memory of how i used to be that s the worst part that girl back then didn t know this wa going to be her life and she can t cope with it she is pretty much dead already it suck finding the point along the line where you realise you can t cope with it anymore part of you know you have been through a lot and understands why you can t keep going but another part feel weak and wish you were stronger i find that i feel weak because my friend don t understand the trauma i have been through so in their eye i think i appear weak and useless and i ve internalised that please i just pray to the universe a a atheist that my body go back to normal then i could stop this obsession this disgust and this shame then i could try to continue to recover from my original injury and i pray too that my injury would improve lastly that i would be psychologically able to recover from all the mental anguish i wish the above so badly but i am utterly terrified it s not going to happen for if that is the case i don t think i will survive i think i would destroy myself probably initially through self sabotage until i could feel i had nothing left to live for and end it entirely,1

i have been through a roller coaster of absolute pain and there is no light at the end of the tunnel that is n't just more of this roller coaster ride the people close to me no longer show concern because that 's just who i am to people now they either do n't know me or they know how much i 'd love to not exist but am still not strong enough to put an end to it and that 's the thing is n't it nobody care until you 're gone nobody care until you can 'prove it we 're 'attention seeker except i 've isolated myself from everyone and i do n't communicate how i feel anymore to anyone but internet stranger who also do n't know me and therefore do n't care unless you 're actually about to pull the trigger people would prefer if you shut up fucked off stop bringing down the mood stop being a burden you 're simultaneously too much and yet not enough they do n't care what 's causing my misery god forbid i mention a person or people are the stressor to what i 'm feeling that is manipulation suicidal people are manipulative we just latch on to people and bring them down i 'm sorry i do n't want to be this way i have asked pleaded begged for help nobody ha offered anything to actually help me throwing vague suggestion and hotlines and website is n't help leaving me to figure out my own shit doe not help at the very least i have learned how to bottle most thing up nobody will have to worry about hearing about my pain and eventually hopefully soon nobody will have to worry about me at all edit i think a lot of people misunderstood nobody in my inner circle is foreign to mental health struggle my mother is half the reason i have them biologically speaking we have similar symptom i 've made it clear what kind of help i need and what i need help with to get there i 'm shrugged off because my struggling with suicidal ideation is not a pressing of a matter a whatever else is going on this wa also general observation of how people react to suicidal people,1

first and foremost do some research on mindfulness/meditation turn those bad feeling and thought into something you can decipher and use to make yourself stronger next find something to fill your time that make you feel good about yourself learn a new language go pick up a yamaha acoustic guitar and look up youtube video on how to play chord and scale look up recipe and video on cooking i recommend cookinginrussia on youtube he will show you how to make thing the right way and display a wide range of region and ethnicity in his recipe these are just a few example next try your best to get rid of that whole lonely bullshit you have to learn how to be happy alone nobody will ever know you or understand you the way you want them to if you have n't taken the time to figure yourself out i ca n't stress this enough forget about impressing other people or getting them to like you you need to learn how to impress and appreciate yourself and one of the best way to get started on this is to be totally alone and free from distraction these are thing i 've only come to term with in the past year or two i feel a if i 've always known most of it i wa just too lost and distracted by well life growing up i never could apply any of it to my reality but somewhere along the way i got tired of feeling so worthless i got tired of only ever finding my value in the eye of others every day is a battle with that line of thought i have to cram it all down and stay focused i have to remind myself quite often that i 've never felt better than i do now and i know it 's because i finally took charge and started putting my own well-being over everything else i have n't had a friend or so in over a year i just do n't care to no one will be welcome in my life until i think my life is ready to be seen and shared with others kinda like how you would n't invite someone over until you 've had the chance to tidy up until then i continue to build from within and keep my eye on the real prize- true meaning and self-worth in my own eye when i get down that is what i think about and for the love of yourself and yourself only steer clear of escapism- binge watching show hour of video game drug and alcohol etc stay grounded in reality face your issue the one inside you what really bother you about yourself when the light are out and everything is silent head on and use what you learn from that experience to make yourself stronger in my opinion that 's the only chance any of u have in being truly happy this post got a little preachy mainly because i wa speaking to myself a well so i apologize if that wa off-putting i hope you get something out of it i wish everyone could figure out a way to be fulfilled no one deserves to be trapped in their own head i wish you all the best op,0

hey r/depression hope you guy and girl are managing today i 've been reading all your post and honestly i can relate hard it 's a weird type of comradery your experience reflect what i 've been through during various part of my life i wanted to share the first thing that really helped me and got my as moving towards recovery brief background year of depression of those with severe panic attack dissociative episode and a close voluntary brush with death nowadays medicated in therapy happier want to live and create going from a to b took some time i think that one of the hardest thing for me wa even deciding to try and work through depression i mean it used to be that most day even brushing my teeth seemed like an insurmountable obstacle this sound stupid but i know most you guy get what i mean so how did i get the ball rolling i started exercising at home started very small perhaps minute a day three time a week and it made a huge difference over time my brain and your brain run on chemical by exercising even for a while what we end up doing is medicating our self naturally endorphin you ca n't help but feel just a little but better however i feel like one of the biggest benefit wa purely mental i would set small goal that i wa able to achieve by myself at my own time in the comfort of my home by myself this is very important because it end up snowballing into other aspect of your life if i could do a maybe i can do b. if i can do a and b maybe i can do c. snowball effect here 's what i want you to try grab a bodyweight program from r/bodyweightfitness start super small build up give it some time and it will give back im not claiming that this is the end-all solution recovery is never linear some day will still be bad somedays you might attempt it and fail others you might feel like you ca n't even try thats fine the same thing happened to me baby step whenever you can every time you make it is a victory and the more you condition yourself the easier it will become trust me i did it and i 'm a fucking loser but now im a happier fit looser that want to keep going im rooting for you tldr exercise saved my life because endorphin and proving to myself i can do stuff,1
i live in the northeast and i 'm pretty much convinced that january through march are the shittiest month of the year but the remaining month are good what do you think i kinda broke it down like this april is when the weather start getting consistently nice spring is nice for being outside summer 's great because it 's warm and that allows for being outdoors a lot swimming hitting the beach etc fall is nice because of football season and the fact that day are still pretty nice at first and by then it feel nice to switch it up a little bit november and december are okay solely because a little cold after or so month of fairly warm is n't a terrible thing and you have holiday like thanksgiving christmas new year etc january through march though there just really is n't much to offer on the table,0
i m so alone right now so much stuff ha been going on in my life in a short period of time first i can t control my emotion or thought and they just play over and over again my year old dog just passed this last week and i m so sad and to top the cake the girl i love just left me too,1

wa about and dated this rebound girl for a few month sex wa wonderful for both found out she wa cheating on me and ended up breaking it off for obvious reason now this girl is in the same friend group so i see her regularly throughout the year we have became civil after this situation so we can still party together etc the night it occurred we we drinking with her and one other friend which i both specifically told i do not want to sleep with rebound girl knowing that would probably could end up being the case with alcohol involved.i got drunk end up partially blacking out and passing out in a room downstairs i later wake up with her on top me not very hard but she s sure trying it wa the most awkward wake up of my life throwing her off the top of me and asking what the hell is going on i wa in shock i don t even remember what she said i grabbed my clothes and left to this day i haven t brought it up with her and i feel a if she doesn t feel like she did anything wrong she s currently married with child so dodged a bullet quite a double standard and therefore rarely have one night stand crazy girl she wa definitely a nympho,0

yep i 'm not going to live through i used to believe i wa a survivor and for awhile i probably wa also for any mod who think they 're smart i 'm behind over proxy so good luck eight year ago i wa diagnosed with ptsd four year ago i wa diagnosed with cancer and had to drop out of school to get a full time job to pay for insurance/healthcare cancer went into remission two year ago ironically only to lose my best friend shortly after all the people who i thought cared or were my friend disappeared and dropped out of my life the second i reached out for help the only resource that i have to reach out to now is a mental health system that honestly doe n't give a shit about it 's patient so a someone with way more experience than the vast majority of people who would recommend me to get help fuck off i have and probably ended up more fucked up than when i first started getting help mental health facility are a fucking joke in the united state the va is useless when it come to the treatment of ptsd or any health treatment a far a i 'm concerned the vast majority of civi mental health unit outside of the va that i 've been to and yes i 've been to a lot over at this point with some having multiple visit are just glorified drug and alcohol rehab facility that have a psychiatrist on staff that allows them to also accept mental health patient a far a insurance company are concerned at least while i 'm sure this great for people with drug alcohol or dual diagnosis issue this doe n't really help anyone else anyone who know me will tell you i do n't drink or do drug probably the reason why i do n't have anymore friend to be honest these place are not going to help people who legitimately only have mental health issue and need help all they 're going to do is take advantage of you and your insurance especially if you 're there against your will all you do at these facility is sit around for day being bored watching tv if you 're lucky enough to have one in a group room and going to one group a day that is patient lead since all the intern social worker doe who ha n't even graduated yet just sits and listens and doe n't really add much value to the group i 've been to the one and only mental health unit in my state that is specifically for trauma patient and while this unit wa far more valuable than the others did n't really help much because i found out that talking about my problem doe n't really do much for me it also sent me off to yet another outpatient facility that wa literally a drug and alcohol rehab facility because they had no where else to send me and did n't want to release me without some sort of care thanks i have one of the most recognized psychiatrist in my region but drug only do so much the only medication that ha helped with the nightmare unfortunately also had the side effect of causing me to have more suicidal thought nothing ha really helped with the flashback and panic attack the regimen of medicine that i 've been taking consists of over pill daily and this is on the lower side of what i have taken in the past last year i managed to break my neck and pretty much destroy the right side of my body that 's not even the worst part i somehow made a pretty good recovery the worst part wa when i realized the sad truth of where i wa at in my life when i wa in the hospital i had people i had n't seen in year coming out of the woodwork to see me in the hospital all of the sudden where were these people when i actually needed them though where were they when my closest friend passed away where were they a few month after i got out of the hospital and reached out for help to everyone i could think of the worst part wa realizing that people seem to only care when they can see you physically in pain apparently they could give two shit about me when it concerned any mental health issue i ca n't even remember the last time i had more than hour of sleep i 'm having more panic attack each week than i 've ever had in my life even though i 'm on more anti-anxiety med than i 've ever been on the only people who seemingly care about me anymore are medical specialist my insurance is paying for me to see i 'm in more medical debt than i 'll ever be able to pay off in lifetime thanks to said insurance refusing to pay for any of the surgery required after my accident last year i probably wo n't have insurance by the end of the year because i ca n't afford it anymore so bye-bye psychiatrist and psychologist and at this point with all this stress i probably would n't be surprised if i died from some cardiac related issue before i could kill myself all the friend i ever had are either dead or not returning calls/texts my family is pretty much fucking worthless i 'm mostly writing this in the hope that anyone recommending mental health unit a a form of help to stop doing that and do some research before continuing to spout of useless information to people who are already in a vulnerable position and if you 've gone to a mental health unit and had nothing good come out of it you 're not the only one so do n't think it 's you that 's the problem a much a it 's just the mental health system failing to actually help it 's patient there is far too much research being done in the pharma field when there is an increasing need for far more research to be done on the neuro and psych side of mental health pharma is just a bandaid tl dr fuck this big dumb earth and it 's big dumb pharma goodbye forever,1

i took the first step in my plan today here 's a little bit of back story first basically i had a kid and i asked my parent to take guardianship i wa in a bad relationship and stupidly put his name on the kid birth certificate he 's a domestic terrorist and get supervised visitation and ha n't even tried to see the kid in a little over a year so my first step is making sure that my parent fully adopt this kid so that he can never get any kind of right since my parent have been saving up money i thought now would be a good time to call our lawyer and figure this out i know it 'll probably take all year but that 's all part of the plan i started a job where i work hour a week and i make close to 4k a month what i 'm going to do is work save up money and once i kill myself i 'll have all the money i owe my family in envelope with the letter i 'm gon na leave them i owe my parent about 3k and i owe my grandparent about 12k if i end up making more than that i 'm gon na try and leave the rest to my sister the child i had i plan on getting a doctor to perscribe me the medicine i want or really anything for that matter cause it dosnt actually matter what it is cause if you can take enough of it you should die i also plan on taking this time to snoop around and find a way into my grandpa 's gun safe and take his pistol just in case i feel like the pill arnt getting me anywhere i 'm debating on if i want to do it on a facebook live post or just keep it low-key so nobody ruin it for me to be honest i 've been planing this for like month if not longer i genuinely feel that i 'll finally be a good person if i kill myself i 'll stop ruining everything for all the people around me i 've wanted to die for over year now i feel like this is basically the best time for it my life ha already been at rock bottom and i still keep finding way to make the hole deeper i do n't see a real point in being alive i 'm only going to make people hate me all i do is fuck everything up so why keep wasting everyone 's time,1

so tired and lonely i m a yo french dude and i live with my mom i m unemployed broke constantly tired people say i m handsome kind smart and i have good social skill haven t had sex in year haven t had a real gf in year have no friend no driving license i love working out lost lot of weight these past few month gained muscle and recently stopped smoking and fapping still all these new habit and victory of the will are but a short a respite from my ever looming depression and self loathing it seems i can never find the strength to do anything with my life i ve spent year living in my bedroom fantasizing about life s possibility occasionally taking action which mostly result in failure these day i don t seem to be able to find the strength to keep going i don t feel that it s worth it the loneliness and sexual frustration are just so painful i numb myself with xanax the only thing that keep we trying is knowing that it would be a huge waste of potential on the brink of saying fuck it though,1
sometimes i think about my current situation i 'm in and i think i have no reason to be depressed and sometimes i see others with depression who have a good reason to be depressed but sometimes i feel ashamed to think i have depression when i think of other people 's misfortune despite my own misfortune i even avoid saying i 'm depressed and just say i 'm sad now because i feel like i 'm insulting those who are depressed,1

when to go to the er i feel like i can t make it i fantasize about different way of killing myself all day every day i don t sleep i hardly eat i cry so hard i throw up every minute of every day is a fucking battle and i am losing the only person i have to talk to about it say it will ruin my life if i go to the er and voluntarily admit myself but what good is my life not being ruined if i am dead i think he want me to die so he doesn t have to listen to me anymore i think he doesn t want to have to go to the er with me i think he is trying to push me over the edge and he say i m crazy and of course he care and want me to get better and he will try to help me find a counselor but he just think inpatient is a bad idea and that i am trying to self sabotage which to be honest is something i am known for doing i feel like even considering self admitting is me reaching past my tendency to self sabotage to try to be better but now i don t know maybe he s right if they keep me for day i will lose my job and i also can t afford to pay for any kind of hospital stay what happens when you self admit will they automatically keep me for day maybe it would be better for everyone including me if i just went through with it and stopped being a burden to the people in my life can anyone give me some perspective i have tried texting crisis line and felt worse both time i just need help,1

i do n't see the fucking point anymore i wrote ton here on why i 'm suicidal my anger my sadness just generally a lot of self pitying somehow expecting my ramble to end with me picking out something that 'll make me want to stay it did n't work i 've had depression and anxiety for about seven year now back in january of this year i attempted to take my own life via overdose however an online friend of mine convinced me to go to the hospital and i can honestly say it 's been the worst decision i have ever made in my life i suffer from so much self-hatred there is nothing i like about myself and there will never be even from when i wa a kid there would n't be one thing i could say i 'm proud of and over the year there 's just been more and more flaw that take over i try and sit myself down and say no calm down this is just the depression talking you 're not a terrible person but at this point i just do n't give a fuck anymore i have n't got any hobby or hobby that actually make me happy i used to feel a if i could get somewhere with my art and animation career but now i literally could n't care le if i tried whenever somebody say why do n't you try do something that make you happy i smile and nod but what the fuck is there for me to do i 've tried quite a few new thing but i just get more and more depressed and frustrated leaving it better if i just do nothing which i know is wrong i think the main thing affecting my mood at the moment is my friend i 'm a really compassionate person and i go above and beyond to try and prove to people how much i care and am willing to try my hardest to make somebody smile i do n't usually get the same kind of response which i usually say is okay but i think it 's really affecting me mentally i have one real life friend who is only really friend with me because they have n't got anybody else to hang about with in the day in freetime they are n't very interested to talk and hang out online i have or had quite a few friend but there 's been a cycle that always happens to me without fail six time the 'cycle go a follows i meet a person/people and become friend with them i become especially good friend with people involved the other person show me the same kind of effort that i put in the other person meet a few other people i try to get involved however am not usually a welcomed the small thing the other person used to do to show me that they cared no longer happens the other person tends not to enjoy conversation/respond much/excessive anger/disinterest the other person only really speaks to me out of pity i know this sound selfish and stupid but i can literally give you six example of this happening pretty much to the exact same formula i fight to try and keep people in my life of course but i 'm not the type of person who get aggressive about it i try desperately to prove how much i care and that i 'm good enough though it usually fall under deaf ear until i eventually give in and just say well they 're happier and better off without me it 's okay i 'll meet new people the thing is everybody is better off without me and after the sixth time for this heartbreak and genuine emotional turmoil i do n't want to try again i do n't want to be lulled into another false sense of security only to be shot in the heart again and again i wish i had somebody who would go the extra mile who 'd tell me hey it 's going to be okay rather than ignoring me until they can be like are you better now i think i 'm going to end my life before the summer i 've been staying for my friend and stuff but it 's really clear to me that i 'm just going to hurt myself more and more watching them fade i 'm going to wait until i know for certain that they 'll be okay i 'm sort of at that point now but idk i 'm sorry for this post i just needed to talk it sound so selfish in reptrospect and i understand that but i do n't ever get to say i just want to talk about why i 'm done with my life and why the only thing i 'm looking forward to is ending it,1

i want to talk about hope the last thing one loses during a depression is hope it may feel like you ve lost everything thrown it all away at time it may feel like you fucked up your life on purpose and sometimes it feel like you had no choice but to just stare at the monument of life a it fall down either way the fact that you are here mean you have hope at least the slightest amount deep down inside it isn t your survival instinct it isn t the fact that you don t want to hurt your family or don t have the courage to pull the trigger your integrity keep you alive in the end hope give you the strenght to keep going or at least stand still instead of laying down to die i have bipolar disorder and i ve pulled the noose around my neck a number of time even though we don t see the light at the end of the tunnel hope burn quietly in all of u i stepped off the chair every time and i m thankful i did a long a you re alive hope stand by your side don t put pressure on yourself to do thing that supposedly will make you feel better one day you will wake up and find that you want to live hope is beautiful you are beautiful peace out,1

my best friend and i had an outburst a few week ago basically she overreacted by claiming that i wa distancing myself during a school trip when i really wasn t there wa a new person in our friend group that made me feel introverted again but she interpreted that a me avoiding her then i got annoyed bc she always seems to overreact and blame me for thing that i didn t actually do once she got mad at me bc i wa getting close to our other friend and leaving her out. honestly i just felt so attacked and also exhausted by the mind game that i sort of texted her abt my feeling of course it didn t end well but now we definitely have a rift and when we used to be able to talk about nothing for hour we can t even seem to talk to each other anymore i hate that it s like this bc it always seems to be happening to me with my past friend and that thought is making me feel worthless in a way i definitely feel so trapped when i m with my friend a if i cant relate to them anymore and socializing drain my energy so much my depression ha stayed constant for the past three week i feel le motivated and a if i m trudging around with a heavy weight that seems to get heavier a the hour and minute drag on i don t want to talk to her about it because i may just be making a big deal out of thing and she s acting normal and happy a ever with her plethora of friend we literally don t talk anymore and just sit during lunch together and she doesn t tell me thing about her anymore nor do i. she s definitely avoiding talking to me because she feel so uncomfortable by my presence which make me feel so bad about myself and in turn uncomfortable in her presence too because i don t know what to say and i don t know what to do because my other friend are all friend with each other and finding new friend is not an option and jesus fucking christ girl are so complicated yea hypocritical bc i m a girl but whatever,1

i gave up reddit for lent and this is what i learned for the last couple year or so i 've been active on reddit almost every day gradually reddit became the only thing i did for fun on my phone i 've never been that into game and i 've abandoned most other social apps and i do n't regret that reddit is awesome but it became a source of daily comfort for me and therefore when it came time to give something up for lent it just made sense my wife and i are n't particularly religious but we decided to do lent this year a an exercise in self control so i deleted the reddit app off my phone and removed it from my chrome bookmark and beyond a thread popping up in the odd google search i have n't read a word of reddit content for the last day and here is what the experience ha taught me facebook is a bummer if you want to be pissed off at the world irritated at people you like and annoyed by irrelevant ad go to facebook but without reddit to kill those small increment of time we spend waiting for thing i turned to this old standby facebook ha sucked for a long time but i keep it for other people 's sake most of the older generation of my family can barely stomach the idea of facebook and to them switching to something else is about like switching from car to rocket ship a their primary mean of transportation they had a hard enough time switching to facebook from their hand-written address book i love these people and i want to stay in touch with them and i can not in good conscience ask them to abandon the fragile comfort they 've found in the digital age so when it come to sharing pic and video of my daughter a private facebook group allows everyone to participate but for me a a way of killing minute facebook is about equal to self-flagellation i miss reading book without social medium to kill time i turned to ebooks i discovered that google 's play book app is actually really powerful and the play store ha a huge library of classic book for bargain price i stocked up on a bunch of bucket list item and even dove into a few heady volume that have been on my shelf for a while for the first time in year i 'm actively reading book i 've always been one of those multiple-books-at-once people but in the past couple year reddit usurped that reading time i like to have different book for different reading spot one for each bathroom in my house and one for bedtime and i like to have different ebooks for different span of time if i have minute to kill i 'll page through a comic book if i have an hour or more i 'll read plato or proust over the last day i 've rediscovered my interest in reading and i wa surprised to find i did n't miss the stuff i read on reddit at all which lead me to the next thing i learned what i miss about reddit is having a place to post thing i 'm not particularly witty and i do n't really have a strong need for attention but every now and then i will happen to come up with a meme or shower thought or discussion topic that my facebook friend might not get but that the wider internet would probably like and facebook is a terrible place to post that kind of stuff it wo n't appear in most of your friend feed and the one who see it will either ignore it or they wo n't understand it and will post some awkward comment forcing you to explain your joke/reference and the whole thing becomes exhausting this post is a perfect example most of my facebook friend do n't even know what reddit is so they would n't understand and virtually none of them would bother reading a post of this length the other thing i miss about reddit is those rare valuable moment where you really make a connection with someone this is one of those area where the anonymity of reddit really work in your favor here people are much more bold with the thing they 're willing to discus because the social consequence of vulnerability are virtually non-existent i follow a few support-group-ish sub and on more than one occasion i 've been able to jump straight into a deep conversation without all the awkwardness and small talk that get in the way in real life even online when you 're talking to people you know every relationship ha baggage that prevents you from getting real with people here you can skip that do n't get me wrong reddit is still mental junk food hell the whole internet is but at least here there are n't any built in barrier to deep conversation so now that it 's easter i 'm back and i 'll probably still use reddit every day but it 's not going to be like it wa the mindless content browsing i did n't miss that at all if i have min to kill maybe but any more time than that and i 'd rather be reading and when i 'm here i 'm going to try to focus on more meaningful interaction i 'll probably never have a life completely free of mental junk food but i 've learned that i never really liked it a much a i thought i did,0

the reason i consider my suicide reasonable most of you will just get offended by this title or text but i just wan na be honest i have a twin brother we both got tested a highly intelligent several time which put a high pressure on u become something oustanding so he became a lawyer with one of the highest degree in his state the only thing he ha to worry about is his twin me same for my mom doctor in medicin and my sister doctor in biology my dad killed himself when i wa year old yet hear i am sitting on my 27year old me i got my a-level but thats all i never felt the drive to reach for any target for me it wa allways about surviving life circumsstances so today i got a letter from my bank telling me to pay back 5k dept in day otherwise they will ‚force me to it wa kind of the last drop that made me give up i wa at a hospital last year when i attemted to suicide but survived and it felt like a turning point in a positive way but right now i lost that little bit of power that wa left i just feel like my family should stop suffering by all that worry they put into me every day i wasted my talent i wasted my youth i just survived day by day using sleeping pill every night to be honest i think in year from now if i commit suicide everybody will be better then they are now even tho they will have a hard time first i lost my drive which a had i wa an actor a decent football player great in making money iin different way now it more like im waiting for that one accident maybe that sleeping pill that is to much i stopped eating stopped drinking i take the risk only for the reason not to intentional commit suicide and let the accident happen i appreciate to have experienced the miracle of living on this beatiful planet but im just over it there is no power left no effort to step up and use my potential so this is somewhat a last call for maybe an advice what i might have missed trying out to not leave this world and live a decent life if i wake up tomorrow which i dont hope im sorry for my word i really am cause they are just destructive but thats the state i am at right now i took several sleeping pill and some other stuff that could not make me wake up and eventually let me sleep forever i enjoied this community and it helped me to make the past year there is this tiny hope of someone come up with a good point i might have missed may god bless you all and forgive myself that i didnt appreciate my talent and life i fucked up doctor couldnt help pill couldnt help peace and love to all of you guy i know many out there feel like me but they are stronger to reach that turning point right now i dont feel like it and i really tried probably this destructive post get deleted to everyond who read it before take care of yourself try your best till the very end if there is a life after one dy i hope it will work out better for me to my mom my brother and sister i am deeply sorry i messed up all i feel is a huge shame on my failure i love you more then anything take care ill be with you forever and ever last word for my twin he got an extra note of course im so proud of you we are the same i know you will struggle the most and i know you are strong enough to make it i love you so much ill be watching you forever we will meet in another life im sure love and hug to you im so sorry,1
the world is hopeless there 's a time and place for politics and it 's not on here so i wo n't get too deep into that but it seems to me like the whole world is pretty much fucked life for the vast majority of people is just going to keep getting worse in this country for at least our entire lifetime if not longer there are people who recognize that thing are bad of course but nothing is ever going to change am i wrong about that and if i 'm right why not quit while i 'm ahead,1

so i pulled a stunt at work this week first off sorry about the throwaway account i really want to spill my gut to all of you great stranger of the internet but do n't want to leave so much identifiable info about me and my job on my main account also sorry for the novel anyway i work a a drafter at an engineering firm and am the low man on the totem pole for the electrical department i 've learned a lot over my time at the company the engineer i work under have slowly been giving me more and more design responsibility particularly for easier thing like laying out lighting and plug and stuff so we recently got this project it a complete gut and remodel of a pretty large existing building they asked me to do the existing condition field survey since everyone else in the department wa busy with other project the building in question wa going to be a simple place to survey an empty building with few interior wall i 've done many field survey before usually they give me the easier one like this so it wa n't anything new for me the project itself is a pretty intense will require completely new electrical everything including a whole new electrical service thankfully while it a very large project with lot of electrical work we 've been doing quite a few project lately that are very similar to this one albeit much smaller because of the similar project i have direct experience with or at least a reference to a majority of the design component in this project with huge exception the electrical distribution while the engineer trust me to do many of the simpler task for them i 've never really had the opportunity to touch the electrical distribution before the engineer have been really awesome though and often explain their design and their thought process regarding them to me when they give me their markup because of these explanation i feel like i at least know the basic of how everything work earlier this week we received the official go-ahead to start on this project but due to disorganization in our department everyone in the department being totally slammed with other project that go-ahead fell on deaf ear i decided to kind-of use this a an opportunity to try to get out of my comfort zone a bit i send an email to the engineer in the department asking if i could take a stab at taking this project a my own designing the whole thing of course before i sent this email i went ahead and did all of the preliminary design work including the electrical distribution on my own without permission figuring that it always better to beg forgiveness than ask permission the head honcho engineer came over shortly after i sent the email to discus the email i sent he wa a bit skeptical but overall fine with the idea particularly after i mentioned that a majority of the project is quite similar to a few others that i wa the one who did the field survey after he gave his blessing i showed him what i had already come up with for the design he sat down with me for a few hour and we went through what i had already come up with particularly the electrical distribution during the discussion i mentioned that i took some pretty big guess on sizing based on what looked right from other project he went through the design with me showed me the actual math associated with designing something like this surprisingly my guess turned out to be correct he actually mentioned that the design looked like something that he would have come up with i know it sound kind-of dumb but i really feel like i accomplished something i 've never felt so excited about work before hell the owner of the company actually came over to my desk today said that he wa proud of me i have no idea how word of my stunt got around so quickly i mean i know that it still super early in the game i have plenty of opportunity to totally crash burn on this project but right now i feel on top of the world,0

i never thought i 'd get this far every day is a struggle and i never thought i 'd make it a far a i have my ex committed suicide right after high school and i always thought that if one of u did it the other would follow suit shortly after i did n't but after year i still feel like i should have i feel like i 've lost control of everything i 'm going through a divorce that i initiated i insisted it wa the best decision for myself but i feel so alone i started talking to a friend of mine that shared mutual interest but they seem to have lost interest and i 'm not sure how to process it i work all the time but i ca n't afford to make a life for myself i got drunk last night and wa kinda hoping i 'd just fall asleep and not wake up but it did n't happen i do n't know what to do with myself anymore everything around me seems to be falling apart and i feel powerless to do anything about it i keep telling myself i have a gun and i could just end it but i 'm scared i do n't want to kill myself but i do n't want to be alive anymore,1
it been over year since i remember feeling true happiness i wish i could blame someone else but what it all boil down to is my wrongdoing when i wa younger i had almost reason to be unhappy i grew up in australia my mum loved me my upbringing wa not abnormal and i always had the essential in life apart from my head being screwed on i never understood prolonger sadness and it took me year to catch a glimpse of why i wa always the person making others feel horrible a a kid i set out to make mischief and make people feel horrible about themselves because it used to make me laugh or just seeing their reaction to me made me chuckle without understanding the true consequence behind my action i went to private school from a young age and wa always given an opportunity to thrive but somehow never realized exactly how easy i had it that realization came when i hit my mum moved country offering for me to come with her but i wa much too headstrong and couldnt bear to leave behind the last year of memory this came in the form of seeing how badly i did in school especially given such a great opportunity seeing these people who did n't like me because of the thing i used to say and do to them at near my old house we lived in the bush i often went for a ride on my bicycle or bushwalks to pas the time one morning on my ride to buy the newspaper in town i saw an abandoned car parked about 50m from the road this wa n't abnormal a people often dumped cars/trash out there so i thought nothing of it the next day came and the car wa still in the same spot so i went to check it out inside wa a man presumably in his mid 20 who had slit his wrist gassed himself and waited to die i could never get this picture out of my head i felt so bad for him i wished i could have helped wa the age i stopped being a bully and tried to fix what i 'd done but it wa too late the damage wa dealt so i set out to change my way i started caring being kind selfless and giving others my time because i wanted to i became that person anyone could turn to and ask for help a place to stay a shoulder to cry on or just giving someone the time of day they had n't been given before at i had a friend called bronze she had been a good friend of mine since and i cared about her dearly i never looked at this girl in any way other than my best fridnd she fell pregnant at this time to her boyfriend who wa a bit of a loser didnt really care much about her but they decided to keep the baby a the child birth came closer and closer he strayed further and further away from bronze but it wa n't my place to say i helped her during her pregnancy by taking her to appointment caring for her like a good friend doe by the time this child wa born bronze wa exhausted a she wa a new mother now bronze lived with her boyfriend in a duplex we had shared for over year fast forward month and the child father played so little in his life she turned to me one day and i 'm not sure why but i acted on impulse having always been the one who hurt others i wa blinded to what really happened we had an affair for month whilst she wa still with this boy and although knowing it wa n't the right thing to do i never intervened all of a sudden this girl wanted to stop seeing me when her boyfriend one day suddenly renewed his interest in bronze so i decided it wa for the best i move away this hurt me more than i could put into word a i had never been on the receiving end of ill feeling i still cared for bronze but i never loved her i still think about her to this day fast forward again month my good friend and i are at a pub after work on a friday and i meet this girl my good friend had gone home a bit earlier a he wa tired i had drank a lot so the detail werent clear but i slept with said girl waking up the next morning to a loud banging on the door and it my good friend turn out he had been speaking to this girl for month but wa too shy to make a move i tried to show remorse even though i did n't know exactly what wa still happening this friend made me feel very guilty and didnt know how to control his emotion still a little hurt from the situation with bronze my mental state wa n't the best said friend told me to kill myself to my face multiple time and the thought ran through my head i ended up being fired from my job a i wa to depressed and stopped showing up for work i had lost my two best friend in the world my good friend mother told her entire family about this incident with the girl and she also told me o should end my life it 's been year and i am still unable to work do n't talk to my mother and have n't felt a will to live my car wa stolen last week and i 've been stuck away from my home town now since over the past night i keep having dream of people i care about dying and/or finding them dead waking up in a pool of sweat yelling some profanity at the top of my lung i would 've put myself out of my misery long ago but i do n't want someone to find me in the state i found the bloke when i wa the thought of suicide doe not scare me it 's more so the thought of the person who ha to clean me up account wa made today a i 'm a regular redditor first time

i wa born a the last out of four child since my early year i 've been kinda different than other child in preschool then in yearly year of elementary school i wa this so nice and polite kid that always do what he 's told what i can remember is that my parent kept doing thing for me up to the age in which i shoud 've been doing myself like brushing teeth lacing shoe etc i remember that preschool age in my country wa the first time i realised that boy pee while standing up and not sitting nobody told me that before not even my father a i think about it now i think preschool wa the first time in my life i had contact with my peer in school other kid started to make fun of me a i wa this quiet shy stay-at-home wierd boy lame when it came to sport etc so i became highly introverted both in school and at home i learned that thing i like and i 'm interested in nobody care in school so it 's better not to talk about these with my peer so basically nobody knew me and knew what i like etc and i 've never told my parent or even my sibling about hard time i had in school because partly i wa so shy and partly because i did n't believe my parent are capable of understanding the problem and resolving it and i did n't believe that they are the type of person i can come to with any problem i wa kinda loner and did n't talk much with my family and never about serious stuff making long story short here i am year old living with my parent and wanting to die i have social-skills and life experiance of a teenager social anxiety i 'm verbally autoagressive and i basically hate myself and my body and i do n't feel i 'm confirmed and grounded in my own gender identity i 'm affraid of going out because of shame of doing that and fear of my parent question about where am i going it 's like i 've never been doing that so now when i want to go out to do any activity or meet with anybody i feel this toxic shame and i 'm afraid of my parent opinion on it i know it seems weird and like it doe n't have any sense but it 's true going to therapy is out of the question because i would never be able to tell them that nor come up with any other excuse for going out so often at specified time of the week for no reason i 've never talked to them about any serious stuff and probably never will basically my only relationship with my family is superficial i hate holiday and family gathering because i feel like an actor performing an act in a theatre it 's all fake because if i were to told them really what i feel i would tell them to all go the hell out and never come again and seeing my teenage nephew being more skilled than me make me depressed even more i have basically no friend the only friend i had moved to another city and i 'm seeing him like once a month my life is living with my parent and infirm grandmother and that 's my life moving out is n't possible when just going out of my house in saturday is an exploit for me i would n't even know how to move out how to orginise that how to do my payment how to be self-reliant i just do n't know what to say more i do n't know whether i 'm even able to describe how much i ca n't control my life i feel like mentally i 'm a kid in an adult body i do n't see a purpose to live it 's like i 'm stuck i do n't want to live but i ca n't kill myself either i just ca n't do it do n't have the courage,1

he straight up said that i chose to be depressed because i chose not to believe in god a if the fact that i ve had horrifically traumatic shit happen to me since i wa a small child ha nothing to do with the fact that i have crippling depression and am suicidal every single day and knowing that he think that of me really fucking suck becuase i thought he wa the only person in my family i could count on my mom is extremely abusive to me my dad is not in my life and i haven t seen him in year and mt other family member couldn t give le of a shit about me i ve never felt so alone in my life i feel like i have no one i can rely on and i have a hard time trusting other people,1
i do n't know what to say back in the middle of february i had a massive blowout with my mom because i tried to call her out on being a horrible parent and being half of the reason why i attempted suicide before she ended up turning everything around on me using my few slip-up against me and invalidating everything i tried to say ever since then i 've been completely unable to articulate my emotion in any sort of confrontational way because i 've been too nervous that what i would say wa just my melodramatic brain skewing event to my favor i 've essentially gaslighted myself into being incapable of standing up for myself my world is still crashing down around me but now i ca n't fight back and try to fix anything because i 'm so scared of getting myself in deeper shit,1
not going to i finish in a year it 's hard to motivate myself like i used to i do n't know what happened i 'm cry a lot more this year since january i do n't know why depression is n't new i 've had for year but it getting worse it 's hard to get up in the morning i feel like dieing everyday i do n't at work because in making money i ca n't tell it because i started hating programming or just in more depressed fucking hell,1

hello everyone i think i 'm reaching my breaking point about half a year ago i wa doing okay i lost so much in just three month i 'm still stunned about it first i got out of job i will spare you the detail i thought i 'd be okay because i thought i could find something else soon enough but then my dog got very ill. i stayed home to take care of him but he died a few week later i wa completely heartbroken he wa my childhood dog the one i grew up with and since i had already lost another dog two year ago i wa clinging onto him i miss him so much but it did n't end here barely a week later i 'm having this huge fight with my male best friend i 'm a woman because i found out he 's been hacking into my computer and had access to all my personal info and more importantly my conversation he confessed on spying on my conversation with my boyfriend and that he 'd been doing so for six month because he wa jealous of our relationship i wa heartbroken again because this guy had been my best friend for so long and i would have trusted him with my life so this definitely felt like betrayal i decided not to talk to him anymore but a if it were n't enough yet no later than a few week later my boyfriend asks me if i would like opening our relationship cause you know there 's this girl that 's really hot and funny and he 'd love to bang her too when i told him that it made me uncomfortable and that i thought polyamory wa n't my thing he left me and now he 's in a relationship with her since i wa the one that joined his group of friend obviously they kept hanging out with him i 'm heartbroken i 'm lonely i 'm spending summer home cause well the trip we wanted to make together wa cancelled i 'm out of job my best friend is dead my other best friend is creepy and my previous boyfriend is a jerk obviously i 'm probably better off without people like that in my life but loneliness is killing me i never wa the best at making new friend even though i love people and finally having some stability in my relationship wa really refreshing for a chance now i feel more lonely than i ever wa i try to talk to new people and try dating apps just to try and put myself out there but most of the time i just feel myself numb to everything i have n't been able to find another job i feel like a loser and my family is getting really pissed at me for cry so easily i totally understand them but i do n't know what to do anymore.some day i just want to curl up and stop breathing some other day i just wish for a new genuine friend to just hug me my life wa comfortable enough for me to feel content and happy and everything collapsed so quickly that i still ca n't believe it sometimes i 'm sorry this is so long i really needed to vent thank you i hope you have a nice day,1
it finally dawned on me how empty i feel i wake up looking at the loser in the mirror and it truly hurt looking back at what i once wa i have n't been happy ever i do n't think doe anyone have any experience with vyvanse and pristiq i have used that before but it 's been year,1

over four year ago my father wa diagnosed with a rare and aggressive type of dementia around the same time i got what i thought wa depressed and lost all motivation to do most anything i simply left my career in a difficult-to-break-into creative industry that i 'd worked tirelessly for year to establish myself in previously i wa making a decent living meeting all sort of interesting people and moderately fulfilled but the overwhelming urge to do nothing suddenly hit me when he got sick and i became an expert at it his disease progressed rapidly and made life at home very difficult the nature of the illness is such that it cause a complete personality change in the person suffering- you perceive them a becoming a monster but that is the illness talking/acting up and really you are the one who becomes the monster due to your inability to remain calm and objective while dealing with them it got to a point in the summer where his condition worsened even further and he had to be hospitalized this wa the beginning of the end you see removing someone so incredibly cognitively fragile from their familiar surrounding wreck further irreversible havoc on their mind often sending them into a state they seldom come back from when the diagnosis is already so grim the two month following the moment he wa taken from home were by leap and bound the most difficult of his life and have proven to be the greatest trauma i have ever endured my dear father passed away on september 27th aged in front of my eye after a monthlong stay at the hospital the absolute biggest regret of my life the useless staff decided they could n't do anything for him and sent him home to die because of the massive shock that being removed from his home caused him his cognitive decline wa majorly expedited and the next step for him wa stopping to eat despite spending every waking moment by his side from 6am-10pm at the hospital every single day and pleading with him to eat he vehemently refused each and every time he still knew who i wa and a few time tried to make me happy by making it look like he ate what i 'd fed him those were the greatest moment of joy for me a i saw hope but a soon a i 'd turn around i 'd see him spit the food out because he wa always agitated and pulling out the iv and refusing all help he spent much of his time in restraint a well a under the constant supervision of a psw his life the last several year while living with this despicable monster of a disease which truly is the worst disease imaginable wa a hell the like of which i can not possibly begin to describe i can not imagine how horrible he felt when he started losing touch with his mind when chunk of information he 'd stored his entire life started falling out but the last two month in specific were something beyond that even hell for all of eternity would be a walk in the park compared to his tragic last two month on this earth being poked and prodded restrained manhandled by several security guard and nurse attempt at force-feeding being washed against your well being exposed to stranger and not least not eating for two month all while your mind is playing game on you causing you to become skeptical and paranoid of everyone and everything i 'm shaking my head in disbelief just writing about it these are thought that race through my mind since he left u but i have n't written about it yet there 's so much more i want to say but it is futile at this point he loved his homeland in europe very much so my last gift to him wa that i sold most everything i owned so that i could cover the cost of bringing him back and burying him there amid his relative just a couple hundred meter from his childhood home in a beautifully scenic mountain range i had no more tear to cry when i saw him get lowered into the ground because i 'd used them all up during the week that elapsed since his passing- sorting out all the paper and formality for shipping a body internationally leaf you in limbo for several week i felt a relief when he wa finally buried in his homeland but that quickly dissipated a i realized what a mistake i 'd made i would now only be able to see him once a year at most of course i 'm aware he is no longer physically with u but having that physical spot to go to to chat with him and pay my respect is a big thing my mother and i then spent a couple month travelling around europe and even had some enjoyable moment but a soon a we got back the reality that we 'd never ever see him again started to settle in- and that 's when i lost the ability to function we got back in early december and since then any for of depression i thought i had before ha been humbled because now it 's at a point where my day are all exactly the same- full of nothing with no 'something on the horizon i ca n't fall asleep until 6/7am because my mind is constantly flooding with image of those last two month of his life the amount of guilt and regret that i carry around is insurmountable and something that will never leave me seeing your father one of the two pillar of your existence who you were very close with slowly die in front of you and then finally depart this world in front of your eye literally letting out his last breath while you watch is a trauma the like of which no amount of counselling or reading or advice can possibly begin to prepare you for i cried and screamed for hour over his body and held onto his hand firmly until the last bit of heat left when they came to collect him the idea that he 'd never be here with u again destroyed me having then to with all the formality of arranging his viewing here dealing with foreign embassy organizing the flight etc wa a sort of adrenaline rush which numbed the pain temporarily for month we were on a rollercoaster with no real opportunity to properly mourn- or rather mourn a we 'd of liked the day and night after his death i just stared at his photo and cried an unbelievable amount no desire to eat drink see anyone do anything a i said once we got back i just completely lost the will to do anything i have zero drive and ambition i am completely content with the nothingness sure this post seems like a plea to escape but really no word of encouragement could move me from the state i 'm in i 'd been seeing a therapist the past few year while this wa all happening and have seen her twice since he passed but that doe nothing for me beyond making me feel better in the moment i 'm getting thing of my chest and for an hour or so after i leave it 's without any real meaning and only cost me money which i do n't have speaking of which i went through the horrible phase of buying thing to make myself feel better unfortunately these were very expensive thing thing i 'd normally never buy not necessarily because i could n't afford them but because they 're quite tacky thing louis vuitton bag dior shoe burberry scarf very expensive sunglass etc. i 'd spent all my money i had to fly dad back to his homeland and desperately needed cash when i got back home just to be able to survive but i blew every last penny on this meaningless stuff which is just sitting in box now gathering dust- i 've no intention to wear any of it it just felt good to buy on impulse i once had a promising career and wa making a decent living even when i left that behind i started a small business which i wa making good money at but now i ca n't do anything i ca n't explain why but i just hit a wall anytime i try that involves anything from making money which i desperately need to trying to lose weight and get in shape which i need more than money or going out and meeting people i am okay with doing nothing and really would prefer it if i could just die already i 'm and have no will to live any longer i 'm not actively suicidal but thought of suicide race through my mind constantly and i 've gone so far a to research certain posthumous legality and thing about leaving a will etc would be awesome if some freak accident could just claim me so that i could be reunited with my dear dad again despite alluding to believing in an afterlife and speaking on hell i 'm not at all religious and never believed in that stuff but now the thought of believing in an afterlife and being reunited with my dad again is one of my last tether to sanity because if the crushing idea that i should never see him again be it in this life or another then i really do n't want to go on,1

i 'm not really aching to kill myself but i 'm struggling to find a compelling reason why not to kill myself i know the usual think of your family and friend that 'll miss you but i keep thinking that they 'll probably move on eventually it just what people do the argument that thing get better doesnt hold much water considering how munch constant suffering there is in the world some volunteer probably told a whole classroom of impoverished african kid that one day they will grow up to be whatever they wished only to leave them and have half of them die of malaria a month later thing didnt get better for them and neither did thing get better for the girl that kept getting back to her abusive family by a social worker you cant tell what the future hold and assuming it going to get better is just a naive a assuming it going to get worse i cant stop thinking about the afterlife and what would happen if i took my turn to die early if there is a god like i believe faith is very shaky at the moment then i just get to meet him earlier than everyone else if there isnt a god then my suffering from depression isnt part of some grander plan and doesnt hold a higher value people will forget who i am in year whether i die now or live my natural life and end up on a deathbed year from now i dont know what to do with myself i keep assuming my friend dont want to be ny friend because i dont even want to be my friend i know myself better than anyone and i cant find a way to reconcile the bad with the good to a point where i 'm worth redemtion they only see what i 'm brave enough to show them and i know for a guarenteed fact that most of them will quickly turn away from me if they knew everything there is to know about me i 'm just tired of feeling like i 'm just on the verge of drowning constantly gasping for air too scared to let myself drown and too cowardly to make a swim for it i 'm going to see my counciler tomorrow morning it midnight where i live and i dont know if i 'm going to be able to really figure something out in the hour long session i get before he let me go and talk to the next schmuck i keep feeling like a passing memory and that my friend and family and acquaintences dont ever really think about me until i 'm physically with them or actively talking to them they 're pleasent enough but i do n't believe their love extends further than the immediate interaction i have for them maybe one or two of them actually care about how i 'm doing but i dont see them showing it outside of a simple how ya doin to alleviate their conscience to pat themselves on the back to say that they 've done their part hell i even went out of my way to call my best friend on the night i wa last planning on killing myself and straight up told him that i dont think he 's ever gobe out of his way to make sure i wa okay and despite his promise that he 's sorry amd is going to make the effort to check up on me from now on i still havent heard a goddamn thing from him in the line of a checkup all the promise of tackling life together from my friend get dropped day after making them and none of the concern extends past the momentary release of feel good chemical they get from extending a helping hand i 'm just so very tired of all of it my past dig it claw into my to make sure im always dragging it around and my future is so amorphous that all the promise it make lost their meaning and a for my present well that 's a castle built on shaky ground that is ready to collapse any moment idk it feel good to get this out of just my head but i 'm so self defeating that im not sure i 'd accept any real help because i dont feel i deserve it fuck it i 'm going to get a drink and have a shower i got ta get a much rest a i can before tomorrow,1

reading through old messenger chat log with old friend and crush hit me with such a sad nostalgic feeling i wa looking through a couple of my old messenger convo 's with people i have n't talked to in year and it 's so weird how it 's all there how one moment you 're talking super casually back and forth about some tv show and then suddenly you reach the last message you sent to that person ever it seems so wrong that most of the time the last message is some super mundane stuff got ta study see you tomorrow like that when i think back to it i almost feel like i should have written an offical goodbye to close it up better i appreciate our friendship and i'am sorry that it ha to end or something lol you remember so much stuff reading through them a well it 's almost like a diary girl i dated or liked hit especially hard how you can see the awkward flirting in the beginning and how you grow more confident until you finally ask her out the loving good night message with heart emojis and then later the heartbroken hurtful word you send it each other that now seems so pitty but at the time all you wanted to do wa hurt each other drunk message plan groupchats exchange of homework silly youtube video it 's all still there if you lean in close and forget your surroundings it 's almost a if you can pretend you 're still there mustering up the courage to send her that first message idk maybe i 'm weird like that,0

throwaway for anonymity i m a third year at my university and i feel trapped in the major i m in my current goal is to be a teacher but i have the misfortune of realizing this at the age of rather than when i had to decide my major to get scholarship money i ve talked about this with my advisor and parent but it seems i m too deep into my current major biochemistry which is full of dull fucking lab work and focus on topic like physic and calculus where i have no interest but continue to consume my time and energy in pointless attempt to care about them to switch to what i really want high school science/chemistry education which would make my class easier and prepare me better for what i want to do on top of that i m bound to a scholarship that won t let me change major or i have to pay a year more in tuition and possibly repay all of the money from previous year they ve put into my education experience. my family isn t rich so i can t put that financial burden on u because i have no idea how we d get out of it i m bound to getting a degree i don t want against my will and there s nothing i can do about it i ve never been treated for depression but given my experience of living with someone who regularly received treatment in my first two year of college i feel like there s some overlap between u i ve gotten into the horribly self-destructive habit of punching myself instinctively whenever something go wrong often in the front or side of my skull bad grade and cram study session set me off all the time because i feel like i should do better even though when i m calm i realize how stupid this is in the moment i blame myself and feel a need to punish myself for wasting my school opportunity i went from the valedictorian of my high school class to a fucking idiot who can hardly pay attention during class and fails exam it feel like i m just sliding by in my class to keep my scholarship money thankfully my dad will listen and give me advice but i still feel an overwhelming need to succeed from my parent high expectation that i don t really want to achieve i also can t tell them about my self-harm because they ve never been in a similar situation and i don t want to upset and disturb them even my social life feel nonexistent i feel distant from my housemate because we live such different life their major look like cakewalk compared to mine and they always have free time on their hand to dick around and have fun while i m locked in my room wearing headphone to block out their noise having to concentrate on shit they go out to bar every weekend with their girlfriend and since i m not and don t have any desire for drink and drug anyway i sit alone in the house every weekend until they come back i d try to look for other friend but i can t do the club i want because of my schedule and the amount of shit dumped on me by my class i go to an out of state college so when i go home my friend from high school seemingly disappear i miss the day in my junior and senior year of high school where my cross country team could get together and play smash bros eat pizza and talk about the gossip going around the school and laugh about life and dream about our future now i feel like an outsider and friend i had for year and year have moved on and left me behind for people who stuck around in my hometown thinking about how many of the fun thing i loved in high school are just faded memory that i ll never recreate put me in tear the only real joy i have left in my life are my parent who i only see every few month watching sport which i feel guilty about afterwards for wasting time when i think i should be studying and music music is my real passion anyway but all i ever hear is how there s no career in it and how i don t have the fucking talent to write or play anything people would care about i try to play guitar and sing but nobody else on campus like the music i do so i can t play gig or even just jam i can barely retain song in my mind anyway which usually lead to practice time ending in me being pissed off and hitting myself going to concert is really fun but they feel so short it s been month since my last and i feel a huge desire to get thrown around in a pit and headbang again being in those moment are the only time i feel alive and that life is fun again because everything else in life just seems to be getting worse it s my one release from these month of fucking hell and they can t come soon enough tldr i don t want to die but my college class are fucking horrible and are eating away at my social life and enjoyment of the thing i like,1

being just a place holder at work how to deal so i started this new job in june last year i wa very excited since it is with a bigger company 20-times more employee than in the job before and i wa promised some major task but from my first day onwards somehow everything went wrong it wa n't clear in my department what my task should be so i discussed it again with my superior and we came to a common solution during the next week i wa busy with training which i had to organise by myself and afterwards i just sat around there wa a lot of restructuring going on in my and other department and somehow i slipped through the grid since january i have a new supervisor in this new organisational structure and i should work but i 'm so used to not being seen and not working that i 'm just a place holder in this office chair i ca n't seem to get back into a working routine and am very nervous that very soon people will notice and i will be getting fired ha anyone else ever experienced such a long time of not being required to work because nobody knew what to do with you and how did you switch out of it again i know this might sound like a situation many people dream about not working and still getting fully paid but honestly i feel like getting dumber and dumber every day and my overall selfworth is completely crushed so if anyone ha similar experience please share,0

i have always believed that something special wa reserved to me since i wa a kid what i ll say will seems to be something out of a generic hollywood story but that s how i felt and kind of how a feel even today i had a difficult childhood and adolescence drug addict father and depressed mom there are very fine memory from those time but the bad stuff stood with me on a more intense manner surprisingly on the current day i have a very good relationship with both of my parent although i don t usually touch on delicate matter for the sake of thing staying fine with u but a usual the past problem left it scar maybe the past struggle combined with my catholic education made me believe that the suffering i passed through and the hard work i try to do on my life will be rewarded by something greater and unknown that s something ridiculous for me when i think objectively about it it stay ingrained at the deepest part of my mind so i always expect something and become disappointed later it happens so these deep ingrained problem stood with me but they were not a deal breaker until now let me contextualize thing for you in the last week i told my bos i wa going to leave the firm in the end of the month i tried to be polite i tried not to reveal my mental instability i told him my priority would be our client s interest until the end so that s why i gave him a month s notice he did not like it but no one like to be presented with a new problem in the beginning of the week i did not commit any mistake a far a i know that could cause a great damage to the firm s asset or our client interest but i felt that would be something inevitable if i stayed there on my current state so i tried to be a honest a possible and told him i going to leave the job i did not feel capable of properly executing now i frequently wake up at a.m. with the intention of getting professional stuff done but i feel unable to do anything at all so i m tired because i woke up too early and i feel like shit for the rest of the day then i go home in the end of the day do i go to sleep early now no cause i did not work properly earlier and now i got to bring work stuff home so i can finish it before the term expires then i find myself at a no ending cycle every time more tired without any motivation to work to write good law thesis clearly underperforming i know i can do better but i am trapped under the lack of motivation sleep deprived and full of sorrow at my heart i already know the work and sleep cycle problem so why don t i act to solve it that s the best question i can think of and i really don t have any answer for it maybe i m mentally ill or maybe i am just a lazy person i feel like i am trapped at shallow hole it look like it is easy to climb my way out but i just can t find any strength to do it i just can t find any strength to start at all i just look at it just think how beautiful the hole s exterior must be just look just dream never take any action never find the strength to do it it s so agonizing i just want to run away from everything and cry myself until i sleep i hope thing get better the world is beautiful and there is a wonderful woman at my side it keep my away from more destructive thought but something must really be done that s why i scheduled a psychiatrist session tomorrow to find out what is wrong to discover the answer to my problem to finally end the fucking cycle that turned out to be monstrous impossible to fight on my own i hope all of you guy have a very nice and joyful week cheer,1

i struggled with depression in high school and college i finally sought help in college and made some progress i had many issue aside from the depression which plagued me i judged people harshly for thing expected people to be perfect and got mad when they messed up vehemently opposed drinking i wa more of a ticking time bomb than i realized i snapped on a new friend because i found out she lied about drinking i struggled to get used to living at college where drinking wa normal and abundant it took a while to shed these thing but before i started shedding them i had some very bad day with depression sometimes i debated the idea of killing myself i attempted to logically think through hurting or killing myself it usually ended in deciding that doing so wa n't worth it not because my parent would be sad or anything of the sort but because i 'd had bad day before and they did n't last sometimes i would feel better by simply getting through the day it became my motto on bad day get to tomorrow i always felt like if i could just survive a little longer thing would get better at first it wa slow day seemed bland and not much better but slowly a counseling dug deeper and i tried to change myself the day after the bad day seemed much better i would find something to look forward to a i reminded myself to get to tomorrow eventually i finished college it wa bittersweet senior year wa amazing because i had handled so many problem and got to a place i mostly enjoyed then came the wait for a graduate assistant position i waited all summer and started falling back into the depressive hole i did thing to keep myself out but the looming possibility of being stuck at home instead of pursuing my dream ate at me from the inside i made one last effort after convincing myself not to give up a couple week later i got a call to set up an interview several month later i 'm chasing my dream and doing something i enjoy every day if i had given up on those bad day i may not be where i am today i would n't have experienced all the great time i had over the year which now stick out more in my mind than those horrible day sometimes all it take is getting to the next day there 's no guarantee it 'll be better immediately but it is always worth the chance that thing will eventually get better i let this phrase be the light inside me that always kept me going get to tomorrow,1

why are people turning reddit into a generic social medium site why is there so many people on this site today posting facebook tier pic and uninteresting family picture to subreddits where they 're irrelevant it seems people are using this site a a facebook substitute why settle on a couple of like when you could get upvotes for something that 's only interesting to friend and family the worst part is we seem unable to criticise any of these post people blindly praise submission which have nothing to offer but an ego boost for the poster any criticism is downvoted to the bottom,0
my friend told me he want to kill himself he basically feel like everyone would be better off without him he drink a lot and is under a lot of stress and pressure from parent he told me not to tell anybody but obviously his safety is most important i have absolutely no clue how to handle this situation and any advice is appreciated i wa thinking of offering to pay for some therapy session and talking him into it or something because i assume the last thing he want to do is spend his own money on something he belief won t help i m really lost and i know this is a very fragile situation and what i do mean life or death with him so please advise me how to handle this also if anyone is going to suggest telling his parent i don t think that would work because a soon a he realizes they know and i told them he will realize the only person he thought he could trust ha betrayed him and that would probably be the final nail in his coffin plus he blame his parent in the first way for how he feel,1

just do n't know what to do anymore i 've posted on here a few month ago when i wa feeling some of the worst emotion in my life since then i 've gotten better i 've seen a counselor who wa n't very helpful i must say i mean she did give me some advice but for the most part everything wa always how are you managing your symptom what if i do n't want to manage my symptom what if i want to fix my life so i can be happy again the problem is that i do n't think i 'm meant to be happy every time i try to get somewhere in my life i just end up worse off than i wa before here i am a college student about to graduate and i have no idea where i 'm going to go from here to be honest i never thought i 'd get this far i thought i would have killed myself by now i just do n't know what to do the only dream i had wa denied from me so now i have to get some job that mean nothing to me my worst fear will be coming true i 'll be winding up just like my uncle who doe nothing but go to work and then come home just so he can repeat the cycle the next day that 'll be me just working some pointless job until the day i die i wish i had never even gone to college if i knew this wa going to happen being professional just is n't a part of who i am in fact i do n't think it 's a part of who anyone is when wa the last time you ever called someone that a a compliment never to me that word mean nothing but phony i do n't want to be someone who sits behind a desk and forgets that they 're not any better than the people toiling away in the factory i guess i just see death a the only way out i want to be happy i want to make a difference in the world but right now neither of these thing seems possible i just ca n't help but wonder if my existence wa just some kind of cosmic mistake,1

just an existential life conversation please include your thought and deepest contemplation are we merely fish out of water jumping out of an ocean of complete nothingness something even le than deep sleep or do we have incorporeal soul that have some type of inertia or momentum of energy are we pure awareness without birth or death or is this it coyote. can there be awareness without perception and subsequently awareness without an instrument of consciousness such a a body what would pure awareness be if there were no experiential confirmation of knowing and being it s like this question plague my entire existence but it really doesn t i still play my video game take my walk go to work etc if i had a greatest wish it would be that forever and always timelessly everything would increasingly become more and more prosperous and awesome and clear a to what the fuck all of this is like why have existence why is all of this here if it isn t always the epitome and seen a the epitome of ultimate ascension and beauty and brilliance and magnificence and peace and awesomeness by all being always i feel like my soul if there is to be a such come out of nothingness through the universe and is up to the surface in entirety it is of love and only want the best whatever truly best mean there seems to be a barrier of unknowing where there s no choice complete uncertainty,0

about to exit thought i would share my life story w you im year old and about to end it all very soon just want your opinion on my life i wa born in mexico in a desertic city my parent were when they came over here they decided to reside in another crappy desert city phoenix az fml right my parent worked their ass off their whole life they both had full time job working pretty crappy job i wa baby sat by my aunt who already lived in phoenix they had kid who were much older i wa about when most of them were 16ish they were buttholes my aunt took care of other random kid a well my cousin would do weird messed up thing to u like show u porn disguise u a the opposite sex force u to drink hot sauce bring home a bunch of food and tell u we could n't have any tell u our parent died in a car crash and would never come back etc one of them wa a cokehead and had random outburst but we never got hurt physically from what i can remember after several year i told my parent of this and decided to switch me to another school which wa about mile from my house at this point in my life i 'm in 2nd grade my parent were always paranoid being illegal and whatnot so being on the street at this time back in in phoenix wa risky they sat me down and told me i would have to walk to school by myself in the morning and when i returned home i would be alone for several hour they for some reason made it weird and awkward to have friend i remember asking my mom if i could sleep over at friend house 3rd grade i think her reply wa no bc what if their uncle rape you at night or the house burn down i pretty much stopped asking her to even go over to a friend house i would wake up go to school come back and be alone for several hour sometimes up to about 6pm this went on from like 3rd grade- 7th grade i do n't remember much just a lot of masturbating and watching tv and cartoon the early sexuality wa probably my cousin showing u porn that early of an age the shitiness start around 7th grade it came out of nowhere it wa a feeling that i could not explain i felt like no one around me wa real and i wa part of some project that controlled me a i would describe it i could not sleep at night a it wa intense anxiety later found out it wa extreme panic attack but at i did n't know this that summer sucked i wa paranoid of everyone around me did n't feel like i wa real there wa a a point where i literally thought i worked for the devil what this meant i do n't know to this day i felt like i wa possessed i felt the urge to say something negative about someone in my head otherwise my ball would itch figuritevly i eventually found out this wa something like ocd up to this in my story it is or somewhere around year old or so the panic attack eventually started disappearing but would come back recurrently keep in mind i did tell my parent the but wa brushed off a teenage stuff i always found it extremely hard to make friend even harder to keep them it is now high school freshman year and do n't understand crap around me i 'm a smart person but just did n't really understand people i tried buying the cool clothes to fit in even started acting like someone different and i fucking hated it at this point i 'm still paranoid to hang out at a friend house bc of fear of parent answer this wa a lack of ball on my part sophomore year i wa making progress panic attack have been gone getting taller about 6ft getting a few girl awesome life is great i guess this is a really random part in the story to mention that of my family life in mexico and u not being able to visit them they would sometimes come visit u complain about how depressing phoenix wa and then leave and the only cousin we had were the buttonhole one and being illegal we could n't leave the shithole phoenix arizona anyway back to sophomore yr. the year ended still a virgin it all good i thought more year also good to mention my dad owned a landscaping business from like 2005-present day and in the summer wa forced to work with him from like 6am 4pm in degree plus weather with one lunch break he wa n't dong it in an asshole way just a way of showing u discipline during these time i wondered what everyone else wa doing making friend for a lifetime smoking weed making memory going to movie etc working in desert day a week sucked as so those were my summer from like 6th grade to like 9th grade by being forced and 12th grade beyond by choice in the summer of or about to become a junior my face and body explodes in acne my face literally exploded i have a pic of when i wa in 11th grade and it

like it wa big girl would tell me anyway i 'm in can school at this point i meet another chick by name of tay we flirt a lot she even touched my junk a few time anyway nothing came out of that she ended up being a le keep in mind my back and chest are breaking out like crazy.had a job a a waiter at the cheesecake factory i remember one time i walked in and some guy wa like hey it freddy kreuger i really do n't know if i just walked in at the precise moment a someone wa talking about the movie or if they were talking about me thats the only time in my life i got bullied anyway it now i go to nursing school i get the attention of maybe one or two girl im doing awesome in school still working out like crazy still illegal and ca n't go to other country still somewhat depressed about scar anyway fast forward to for some reason my chest and back acne are getting worse like of my back is covered in cyst and my chest literally look like someone burned me with an iron bc of the scar imagine dwight from the walking dead how half his face is burned thats what my chest looked like bc of the scar acne still somewhat active i start talking to this girl from school she for some reason ended up disappearing for a semester but she came back and wa now a step behind me in academic same school same life goal etc anyway we start hanging out i can tell we are really into each other we have a loooot in common she wa about year older tho did n't really mind after maybe a month of hanging out we make it official bf and gf nursing school make it hard for u to see each other since our schedule are different and nursing school is busy anyway it the start of and we start getting more serious doing more thing etc she asks me to the my shirt off i freeze and in my head i 'm like oh fuuuckk i make up a stupid excuse which wa that i wa hairy and hated taking my shirt off she said it all good whatever made me comfortable i decide to do something very serious for all thesis scar on my face and body i go to a dermatologist and take my shirt off his response wa holy fuck dude you got a fuckload of scar yes this wa a doctor anyway that hurt like fucking hell so i wa like yea i know what can we do his response well this is the worst case of acne and acne scarring i have ever seen your back and chest will never go back to how it wa this also hurt like a fucking ton of brick in the back of my mind i always thought there wa a laser that i could get and perhaps only need session and my back would be decent but no it turn out skin is much harder than that anyway i pay for a session of laser only for my entire back they hurt like hell and i do mean fucking hell my back wa numbed for an hour then she did a few layer with one machine called an intracel which is micro needling with radio frequency piercing about 2.0mm into your skin idea is to stimulate collagen etc followed by another laser called sciton halo which i can only describe a a mini blowtorch peeling away a layer of your skin whole procedure took about hour i literally wished i wa legless i wa shaking in pain during procedure even doc said that this one procedure would maybe give me a improvement in the active acne and in the red blotch of hole that i had i took that chance anyway meanwhile i land a job that pay fucking awesome for me not doing much i work full time at this point i break up with my gf bc i figured she wa gong to see me shirtless eventually and wa going to be disgusted with me i could already tell she wa somewhat disgusted with my face maybe perhaps not she wa nice and she wa gorgeous she wa like no other girl i had ever met .i break up with her before i end up getting hurt even worse she seems to not mind that much when i broke it off with her ill never know at this point i decide to drop out of nursing school a few month shy of becoming an rn to fix my scar bc nursing school wa busy and i did n't have time to make a decent term appointment it is now february i gave up hope that anything will fade my scar on my body and face since i start talking to people on forum such a acne.org and they tell me they have spent thousand of dollar and time to only receive about a improvement in scar my back and chest are annihilated always hated spelling that word it difficult month go by and literally no improvement in my back from that torturous procedure i had done on my entire back ive been on strong antibiotic and will not go back on accutane since it did n't work the first time i gave up hope that anybody will like me for who i am may sound like i am exaggerating but my back and chest are fucking disgusting one procedure i had done on my face left my face a tad bit worse than it wa and i see my gf posting stuff on snap that is n't necessarily saying she found someone new but it getting there i work in the medical field and have found a perfect opportunity recently to end it all apart form the acne which ate a whole chunk of my life i feel like i wa always different like i did n't understand why people danced how people could be happy i never understood why try to get a job if literally nothing matter you and me are but a speck of dust in a misundertood and unexplored universe which could pretty much be a tiger dream in another dimension i always believed job and money were only invented to distract u from the fact that we are but a lonely fart that is 1/10000th of a millisecond long i could never explain how people have such clear skin i literally saw this one guy once in tucson az he wa super high on an opiate i presume anyway he wa laying in his own piss n a dirty as bathroom while his reparation were like 5/minute he wa probably like the only thing i could think of wa how in the bejesus wa his skin so clear he is rolling in his own piss and he is dusty meanwhile i 'm over here wasting hundred on high grade med and topicals and my body hate me i 've never done drug never smoked never drank literally the only thing i drink is water and organic crap so my diet is on fucking point yet my body fucking hate me i literally have never seen anyone with skin like mine only one guy on acne.org who 's entire body kinda looked like mine but he ended up disappearing from the forum feel like no one understands what it is like making eye contact is fucking hell how am i going to get a girl if i ca n't even take my shirt off ive never been swimming it look fun o yea and folliculitis keep running down my arm literally have no friend my best friend is my year old brother and i love him to death he reminds me of me i can literally feel the depression in his soul he is never amused by anything and it seems like he is lost maybe it wa genetic maybe we are missing something in our brain that is also linked to extreme acne he doe not have acne though and i hope he never get it at his age i wa already being consumed by that godforsaken bacteria p. acnes.i literally wish could trade my leg or my arm for the disease only bc my case is extremely bad and i do n't wish it on anybody peace out eveyone let me know what you think of my life if i get around to reading it,1

i guess this is the second journal entry i 'm not entirely sure what i 'm trying to do with this but i know that after writing i feel better and le burdened to a certain degree first post is in offmychest http //www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/apjgul/i_cheated_as_a_last_hurrah_alcoholism_depression/ x200b aye the kid 's back at it coffee next to me laundry on the ground and a sink full of dish x200b i 've come to realize that the state of our house is usually the state of our mental health though i like to keep a clean workspace my closet tends to be a disaster area so in reality it 's the area that we do n't show to everyone else that we can correlate to our mental health with that being said i hate it when people ask me how i 'm doing she asked me to read her what i wrote yesterday she told me that i tend to write more in depth to a situation than when i talk about it i learned that in much speech there is much folly i need help there i said it i depend too much on others opinion rather it 's the opinion of the father that i 'm seeking out and not the sin that is passed down to me the messed up part is that i find it hard to accept any accolade from my father because i tell myself that he ha to say those word because he 's my dad that 's why i like meeting new people if they like me then it 's a reassurance that i 'm not too much of a screw-up treat yourself love yourself be yourself know yourself that 's the rub right there if i do n't know myself enough then how can i treat it how can i love myself when i do n't know how to be myself myself is filled with doubt and lack of trust i used to give to people and it wa up to them to lose it i grew up in a close knit loving church family to only be exposed to others that wanted to take advantage when i wa taught to show love and humility the other kid at school taught me pain and embarrassment when i saw that others enjoyed watching this pain i knew that the only way to fix it wa to remove myself from the equation we moved after my first 'cry for help i swore i heard god 's voice a i reached to load the shotgun i wa happy to hear his voice so i put it back and then told my parent about the miracle at dinner my mom cried a she cut her pork chop so hard it cracked the plate i thought it wa the power of the lord turn out it wa pure sadness and fear i could n't change my giving heart i could n't change my care for other people i could n't change the fact that i did n't understand why other people would want to hurt someone they did n't know i grew angry fighting became a constant there wa always someone wanting to fight me at any time of day it wa weird random people would go out of their way to say something kid i never met would start fighting me but i kept my smile i kept my happy face and jovial manner and did what any good man would do and take that pain and stuff it down and file it away soon that pain had it 's own room and eventually it 's own mini series that played at random interval throughout the week i learned to hold my tongue i learned that i wa not worthy of love i learned that state issued psychiatrist were a joke i learned how to lie so people could n't get to the real me i learned how to dance and have fun all the while maintaining an awkward boner i wa growing up and refining the tool in which to survive with i wa beating plow into sword and then back again i need help and i do n't know what tool to use i need to win this battle even if i 'm scared of losing or winning i do n't know the coffee is cold again and there is a lot of laundry i 'm looking into some aa program for next week and will go from there stay strong,1

i have good news bad news and cake what do you want first i 'll start with the bad news i have a doctor appoitment tomorrow that i 'm very anxious about if any of you have seen my comment in the past year you 'll know i do n't have a good track record with them and to signify my inner meltdown i 've had nonstop for the last year my last cold root beer exploded and made a huge mess except here is the good news all this time i thought i did n't hold the card that everyone else in this life and death had more control over me then i did i wa wrong i 'm not doing good right now i 'm not going to lie but do you want to know the good part i have a dream that is perfect for me a cause i want to fight a friend wedding to see and a world of opportunity i also have smash bros. all of that is in the near future and it will be there when i 'm ready because unlike my root beer i am not having a complete meltdown i am not falling to the floor in tear and scream anymore i hold a lot more power then i once thought i did i think i proved that by now since coming to reddit i wa threatened on my life by someone on reddit had a friendship turn toxic faced starvation lost people etc i had possibly the worst year of my life and i 'm still here it 's hard to remind myself that the battle is over that i survived against all odds but i did it it took losing everything to know who i am and what i want now i just have to not be afraid and go for it who 's with me,0
i always feel lonely but that s because i never initiate contact i don t have the energy to do so i feel like i m losing my friend and that obviously doesn t help with feeling lonely in a nutshell i m lonely and it s my fault i feel this way i could do so much to help myself but i don t this frustrates me and piss me off so much i hate myself for this it s like seeing something you want right in front of you but there s a glass wall between you and the thing you want sometimes i ask myself what s wrong with you the obvious answer would be you re bipolar but not really i can t blame it this is my doing i m letting it control me,1
it s not their fault it s mine i had ton of friend in high school we hung out almost every day i wa always over at someone s house saving sleepover playing game after high school i kept in touch with a few but you separate and move on somewhat right made two friend in university i dropped out after my first semester and just started working everyday i wa and still am too ashamed to see some people because while they ve gone on to do good thing and good school and good job i m doing nothing with my life i m fatter stopped caring about my look boring working a dead end job every-time someone asked to hangout i said i wa already working eventually people stop messaging eventually people stop caring i just finished up my shift and wa scrolling through instagram after getting changed i m alone at work and i m just waiting for my wet mop patch to dry so i m just standing around in the bathroom being lazy and waiting someone s picture scroll by of their birthday celebration it s in black and white they ve got big silver balloon behind them with their age they re dressed up they ve got a little tiara on their head she look happy and she s tagged her friend who she s out with i knew her in school not really friend and i ve seen ton of picture like that before load of time especially on instagram for some reason it just struck me being happy out with friend someone s taking their picture celebrating their birthday they ve got a little tiara and they look like a friggan princess my birthday coming up and i just realized no one will ever do that for me i haven t been out with the girl like that in almost year no one going to take my picture get me balloon let me wear a stupid little tiara and sing me happy birthday it s so stupid i don t need those thing i feel like a spoiled child but i just feel so alone it made me burst out cry and i can t stop cry even writing this because i crave friendship but i don t even know where to look anymore and if someone were to come along and offer me their friendship i wouldn t even know what to do anymore i feel so stupid i have a loving boyfriend who would do anything for me and is my best friend but we see each other every day and sometimes you just need something a little different than the same person all the time sometimes i feel so selfish and needy for thinking that update/edit thank you to all that commented i didn t think my midnight ramblings would get this popular and now waking up to it and rereading it i feel better having vented and cry it out some of you gave deep insight on your own life and what friendship mean to you or how you ve lived without friendship a well i really appreciate that and i hope everyone here find their version of happiness regardless if friendship is in their future or not i have two hangout scheduled for the end of this month and may so if those go well i m going to try and push myself to get back in touch with more people while i do like my alone time i also realize that maybe my friend who did keep trying to reach out to me maybe still do care maybe they still want to see me and ask how my life is and i should take that chance to open up to people again thank you for listening your story and your advice,1

holy fucking shit i hate myself i always try to get drunk because i think it will make my thought more erratic and random but really it just isolates the thought of self-loathing i probably do this sub-consciously because if i focus on the reason that i hate myself i will be more likely to kill myself focusing on only the negative thing about me obviously i am going to ignore the positive thing about me and only focus on the thing that make me want to remove myself from this world i say this world but really we only get one life i don t want to start over because there is no starting over we get what we get but i think that i m too weak and pathetic a person to improve for the better and a half that i sometimes round to to make myself feel better and sometimes pound i fluctuate between but usually i m below that s skinny a fucking shit basically skin and bone i look at my wrist and i fucking recoil in disgust because i can see my individual wrist bone along with that i am either extremely shy or don t like people either way i wish that i would interact with others more what i want and what i wish i wanted are two different thing this is an incoherent mess because what i think is luckily i m drunk but when i m drunk i just spill my mind s thought this is kind of good but kind of bad i can t talk like this while sober this ll be the end of this post because i have to piss if someone tell me i m not that bad i won t believe them if someone tell me i m a good guy i won t believe them just ignore me because this post isn t inherently suicidal yeah i am suicidal but this post isn t saying that i ll shoot myself in the head or choke for a couple minute by hanging myself if i banged myself i would make sure that it snapped my neck instantly i m a former state wow i ve fallen pretty far swimmer so i know how scary the feeling of suffocating is if i am going to kill myself i ll make it instant either jumping off a cliff shooting my self or having enough height while hanging myself to instantly snap my neck that s my slightly or not idk drunk post respond if you want i don t care i only say that to reinforce the i m a tough year old ego that i ve adopted peace out i probably won t kill my self tonight so maybe this post will be deleted if you re reading this you should probably better invest your time with someone who ha a rope around their neck or a gun pointed to their head right now may the world have peace patrick h. i want to fucking scream but i can t or i ll be hospitalized ironic smiley face,1

weird thing you do what 's up cc what are the weird thing ya 'll do i 'll start i have this weird form of escapism where i constantly picture myself in other people 's life for example for the past year i gained an interest in choreograph dance because of a famous dance studio in korea they do load of original choreo video to ton of popular song i saw one on friday that had a really cute part in it http //youtu.be/sdal5vcdkpc t=20 sorry the link might load on speed for some reason and if it start at the beginning jump to the 20 mark the part where the guy is on his knee and the girl walk around him the way she look at him wa so cute i know it 's just part of the choreo but it wa like i wish i could find someone who looked at me like that they both seemed to have so much fun in the choreo and a i watch more and more of their video i start to daydream about myself being a choreographer at that studio and being friend with all of them there they have a big social medium presence and it look like they all have a blast working there so i kept imagining myself in all the picture and video i 've seen and being friend with all of them even in the link earlier i imagined myself being the guy in the video it 's his choreo and creating other awesome dance choreos whenever this kind of thing happens i just get almost obsessed with indulging in this mental escapism and then i get really depressed for what could be a few day to a few week i just become disengaged from life and just spend all my time daydreaming it 's really unhealthy i know this probably sounded really all over the map haha sorry for the wall of text so what are weird thing you do,0

how to cope with suicide of a loved one a someone who is suicidal hi this is my first post on here so sorry if i do this wrong or anything i 'm year old and have actively contemplated suicide since i wa it continuously feel like it 's getting better then worse in this gross cycle that i do n't even know how to describe recently it feel like i 'm drowning whenever it wa so bad it felt like i wa carrying around a yoke on my head i saw a post on snapchat from someone from home that said pray for the family this last name wa the same one a mine a someone who life in a dorm a few hour from home i immediately thought something could be wrong with my parent i texted them but my parent and immediate family were both okay i did n't think anything of it brushing it off and telling myself it wa some other family with my common last name until i went onto facebook and saw obituary upon obituary for my cousin this hit me hard he went to school a half hour from my house wa a soulful kind boy who wa a mere week younger than me we went to church together sometimes and he wa one of the most genuine people i could name i could n't find what happened anywhere and i knew he had n't been sick i assumed something tragic had happened like maybe a car accident etc my heart felt heavy but i could n't place why the next time my parent came to visit they told me that he had committed suicide this wa two month ago i think of him every day i witnessed first hand the grieving process of suicide in my family and i ca n't help but think what if that wa me what if that wa my parent who were stuck in a depressive spiral after their 16-year-old seemingly perfect kid committed suicide in their own backyard what if it wa my death that turned my whole community upside down i ca n't come to grip with the situation the day that he ended his life wa the same day that i wa contemplating ending mine he ended his in the exact same way i wa thinking about mine probably minute away his family is my family i need help here it 's pushing me closer to the edge,1

doing something very stupid very well the company i 'm currently working for though not for much longer is not run well it 's been an overwhelmingly frustrating experience but the silver lining is that i feel like i 've ascended to a whole new level of competency by having to execute often harebrained idea while maintaining my own personal standard of craftsmanship i 'm frequently asked to do thing without the right tool not enough time and straight up inaccurate information often i 'm given two person job to do alone that i think i 'm only capable of because i literally have acrobatic training normally i 'm happiest doing challenging work but here i feel everything i 'm doing which is just to make up for others inadequacy and should n't be challenging in the first place is completely taken for granted but i have discovered this newfound sense of grudging possibly spiteful satisfaction in making shit happen that wa otherwise destined for failure it 's not ideal but better than nothing i guess anyone else managing to find personal fulfillment while at shitty job,0

an interesting observation hi everyone i have an interesting question about this sub first of all i am in a better space at the moment so this is more hypothetical right now why is it that when people post that they are suicidal everyone tell them they should n't do it and say thing that are good in the world etc and yet many of u are still actively suicidal ourselves like why ca n't we extend the same courtesy to ourselves that we do to others i do n't mean it in a mean way or anything i have been there too and an likening to be again i am just curious and would like to have a bit of a discussion thought anyone,1
i wa just reading a text i sent to a friend telling him i wa going to commit suicide sorry for the mess i ca n't seem to organise my thought it so weird how everyone reacts in the same way along the line of people will miss you people care about you i care blah blah blah but it last for such a short amount of time i 'm curious a to whether they care the only time people seem to give shit about me is when i express my suicidal tenancy or show how miserable i am i 'm reluctant at saying i 'm depressed since i do n't really fully believe in self-diagnosing before telling them they literally show no sign of caring about me or even attempting to talk with me i always have to be the one i find it hard to believe anyone care only person in my life ever made genuine effort in my friendship with them and i had to push them away because they of the toxicity they caused in my life no one ever reach out to me no one ever start convos with me i 'm never going to be anyone 's first if i were to stop starting conversation with people or assert myself in social situation like oh can i come i will surely be forgotten and pushed aside in fact it actually true i also find it bizarre how my friend just seem to have what feel like forgotten me when you tell someone you 're suicidal you get gush you matter/i care kind of talk but that literally only lasted a day i 'll take you to the university counselor lmao i had to walk myself there since they all seemed to forget their promise not exactly a surprise tbh the only reason i went is because of them really i would n't have went if it were n't for the fact many of them kind of made me promise i would seek help i expected a different reaction i suppose maybe a desperate attempt of feeling loved and receiving care i feel a bit manipulative and guilty which make me feel even worst but i really just want to feel loved and i want to know that there 's at least someone who give a shit about me i usually never tell people how i feel or about the fact i 'm suicidal i keep it to myself because i tell myself people wo n't care and i guess i wa right,1
what s the point of living if i have all these problem am going to list i am boring it s hard for me to talk to people nothing come to my head and i am not funny or interesting i barley have any friend and in school i spend my lunch time walking outside for an hour i am a weak low testosterone beta male who lost to a year in arm wrestle i am i weigh 68kg and have tit i get tired quickly and i am lazy i m a low energy person i have sleeping problem it take long for me to fall asleep and even if i have full sleep i still feel tired while my friend ha hour of sleep and that s enough i could barley do my school work due to heavy procrastination top of my hair feel thinner than my side meaning it s thinning what make it worse is i wa trying to grow long hair shit and poor family due to bankruptcy no point if i m not going to be able to enjoy life edit my stomach started hurting after writing this it hurt to be right,1
calling all youtubers my son is now a youtuber i found out last night that my year old son ha started recording himself playing game on his ps4 and sharing them on youtube i actually am proud of him for figuring it all out he ha also figured out how to do it on his phone a well i do n't expect him to be the one in a million youtubers that actually make money but i 'm happy that he ha taken an interest in doing it i know that he watch enough youtube video to know what he would like to make for content what fascinates me is that the ps4 ha all the built in feature to do all of this i am starting to feel out dated because of this i 'm a computer scientist and i still get exited to see thing like this now some of you would probably worry about privacy issue and if my son is uploading thing that are appropriate well now that i know he is doing this i will be closely monitoring him while encouraging him at the same time i already told him a few tweak he may need to do to be more appropriate for example i felt he had an offensive youtube profile pic so i had him change it so what i want to know is are there any of you out there that are youtubers or have kid that do it how successful have you/they been,0

why everytime i make a post on reddit someone make a comment revealing personal information about me i consider myself to be a major thought leader around here but everytime i make a thread i am hacked or have personal information revealed in my thread i have alot to offer reddit concerning how thought feeling are perception are influenced they tell me how much is in my bank account what i do for a living incident from the past etc they say it slyly to not arouse too much suspicion because they need to keep the site going to entice more anti trump dialogue to fulfil aspect of their agenda everytime i comment on here i am targeted by comment designed to effect my confidence to a point where i feel i 'm not important enough,1

having difficulty waking up in the morning i just moved to a new apartment over the past weekend it 's a basement apartment and even though there is a big window and i mean huge there is very little direct sunlight that come through it i usually try to wake up between and for work but the past few day i 've continually snoozed my alarm and not getting out of bed until last night i tried to put my phone further away from my bed but when the alarm went off i just grabbed my phone snoozed it and got back in bed it 's really frustrating to me a i have n't really struggled with this to this extent since i got out of college any tip on becoming someone who can get up with the first or second alarm,0
why am i just crazy or weak or misguided or doe anyone really care why ca n't i control myself when i have a breakdown i do n't even know why i end up cry i just ca n't stop thinking to myself about how shitty of a person i am that i do n't deserve the life i wa given and that i should die today at school we were having rehearsal for out talent night being a senior and president of the production crew i thought hey this will be fun i love this stuff anyway not even into the first act thing are going wrong and the teacher are just passively battering me with oh oh oohh name this is n't looking to well for you guy most of crew working today should be skilled individual but it seemed like they all just did n't want to do anything or take any initiative halfway through people start asking me if i 'm alright because my resting face is apathetic and like anyone i talk to i tell them i 'm fine it 's getting late and we order pizza for the crew i do n't eat i wait for everyone to eat and if there is anything left i eat mainly because it 's been a habit that i starve myself and i just started feeling worse midway through my morality went down my competence went down starting doubting myself about thing that i normally have control over the teacher started fixing thing that i thought were right i walked into the washroom and into the stall and cried for a while until i cooled off and pushed through all the kill yourself you worthless pile of crap thought that never stop i hate when people ask me if i 'm okay when i want to hide it because it just make me want to die even more and when i do want to talk about it with someone they either abandon that friendship/relationship or try helping when they ca n't or continue to say oh dont tell me like just fucking listen to me and hear me out it 's all i ever ask but now i want to die my ex-gf is one of the individual helping out with the show a part of my stage crew because she is n't too bad at it so my exec team chose her i respected her for a long time a friend of mine that knew a lot about me i do that to individual who i do n't see worth hating over but why doe she not even look at me why is that you go from love to hate when someone say i want to break up the worst part is how she broke up with me i wa at a really low point lower than now when were month in i slipped maybe time time i told her how i truly felt on separate day time i slipped and that 's all it took for her to ghost me for month and then break up with me over a text message i did n't care if she helped me when i spoke to her i just knew that she wa one of the only people i trusted and that cared for me i do n't talk to my family on a regular basis and i live with them i have n't spoken to my brother who life in the next room in about a month not a word i also hate driving my dad want me to drive we go out on a drive one day and i almost crash and kill u both luckily he punched me in the face and took control of the wheel for a bit my mom might be my only friend at home but even then i dont tell anyone anything i do n't see a future for me sure i have university acceptance sure i live in a house have dinner to eat alone with have a semi-good computer and all these thing but i want to fucking die i ca n't take it anymore i hate having uncontrollable emotion i hate who i am i just learn to accept that im a loud obnoxious nosy senior who ha nothing better to do than to kill himself because in reality no one care i have no friend at school my only close friend are n't even that close to me of them life in another country some hundred of kilometer away the other might hangout with me but he find that our other friend that left u is better than me and worth more of his time i wa walking home today and picture myself dead on every bridge i passed pictured myself dead under every bridge i passed why do i even try why not give up it 'd be a total relief just thinking about it i would of course be the burden of many thing like uni application and the production crew but none of that would matter anymore if i died right am i fucking right can someone please stop this fucking voice in my head gnawing and scratching the end of my head why do i feel like anytime someone asks if im okay they 're just going to go home and forget what i said and how much i want to fucking die why find love if they just break up with me before a month mark why find love if they lie to me and then ghost me for a month while i work with kid and get appraisal for being good with them and them asking me to comeback why try to be a good friend to people who do n't look the same way i look at them i tried really hard being alone and i honestly give up i ca n't do this anymore i just ca n't i do n't know if it 's even worth saying sorry for not being strong and being a weak little bitch of an arab kid who look white a fuck i 'm sorry im realistically sorry for being a piece of a shit human i wish i wa a miscarriage like my would 've been youngest brother that would 've turned this year but did n't is this even the right place to put this why do i even try someone please end my suffering i 'm not even diagnosed with depression but i think there 's a good chance that i have some sort of mood altering illness i can be happy for second and immediately switch to wanting to die maybe i 'm bipolar maybe i m just a crybaby bitch that deserves to die maybe i still have feeling for you even when i told you how i felt at my lowest and you ghosted me for it why am i like this,1

i 've become so apathetic about thing that should really matter in life when i think about thing like failing uni losing relationship messing up my future etc all i feel is a kind of numbness i truly ca n't bring myself to care i used to be so anxious about these thing all the time i used to feel physically ill. but now i go through life feeling numb and grey i ca n't be bothered getting help because i do n't really care about getting better but the smallest thing can set off a full meltdown and suddenly i feel the weight of every failure on my back burn the last piece of toast and suddenly i 'm hysterically cry about how i 'm going to fail uni and ruin my future and i 'm such a worthless idiot etc etc i do n't understand why i ca n't make myself care when i need to or in any meaningful way at least when i 'm anxious i am working hard and trying to make/keep friendship etc,1

dear all those living with depression i want to start by saying that i am no expert and that all of the information below is purely based on my experience and opinion regardless i hope that this post help a famous ancient chinese man yeah seems random i know name lao tzu once said if you are depressed you are living in the past if you 're anxious you are living in the future if you 're content then you 're living in the present step realise that the past is the past you ca n't help what ha happened you must try to move on but also in the process of moving on from whatever awful experience you 've had do n't worry about the future or you 'll land right back where you started so that 's two part of the quote the next part is living in the present i want you right now to come up with a many thing that you 're thankful for having in your head right now thinking about what you already have and appreciate having/are privileged with having get you on your foot but it the first of many step to finding your 'happiness x200b step what 's your passion everybody ha a drive and a passion it what inspires u everyday who we see ourselves a a a result of this you need to have moved on to continue these step i want you to focus on your drive what get you up in the morning even though you tell yourself it 's just gon na be another shit day focus on it and make some goal a stepping stone derived from your passion this is the beginning of your path to happiness strive to accomplish these goal if you do n't want to achieve them then they 're not really associated with your passion this is probably the hardest part of the system outside of moving on to immediately pinpoint what we all really want can be really tough even if it take you a few day of thought to do it you 're on track with your passion a your drive and your goal set push to the finish line now this is tricky some day it will be hard guaranteed and eventually that drive may fade a a result of sinking back into old habit so i want you to set aside a little money each week or month and pin down a date on that date i want you to treat yourself a little even if it 's just grabbing a chocolate thick shake from mcdonald 's down the road the feeling of rewarding yourself should just be the spark/kick you need to keep on moving x200b step the infinite step sound daunting yeah well this step is just well life you 're on your way i ca n't help any more from here the infinite step is purely just adopting healthy practises to help you not to go back to the state you were at the start of these step tip every night when you go to bed instead of worrying like many others go again through your head everything that you are thankful for take deep breath between each one x200b tip try not to associate yourself with negative people by this i mean people who bring you down make you feel like you were at the start this might even mean cutting off connection with a friend even just for a little while i do n't mean disassociate yourself from others in your position once you complete these step a a former sufferer of depression you can really make a connection with those who are in similar position you can empathise more with them than others can and you can help if you choose to bring many people out of the hole that they have dug for themselves x200b tip pas this on to someone else you know is suffering with depression x200b i do not know if this help at all i can just hope please feel free to ask any question in comment good luck for all your future x200b,1
i am one step from doing this i am currently sitting in the forest away from town i live with the rope inside my bag i ve found a quiet place where bird are singing it s so peaceful here i ve written suicide note to my family friend but there is one thing that bother me should i text my mother and tell her how i feel about my depression suicidal thought it s hard to do because i m afraid of her reaction maybe she will go ultra mad and that will break me even more on the other hand what have i left to lose i ve told some people about my depression they didn t cared enough and if i ll make right now a promise to my mom that we will discus about this at home where are guarantee that she will care maybe she will think that i m just a whiny idiot because life is hard and yada yada the thing is i m not sure that i want to die but i don t have will to continue this meaningless existence so it s very complicated conflict that is happening right now in my head sorry for grammar,1

can you ever reconnect with an old passion i have this bad habit of exhausting my favorite thing because of overexposure i can become easily obsessed with thing and then drop them suddenly and lose interest however what 's tearing me down is that i have special thing that i can no longer enjoy because i used to be so obsessed with them that they 've lost their magic for instance i used to listen to certain band so much that now even though i consciously like them i like the lead singer 's voice i like the genre i like the structure of their song etc i can not enjoy them anymore because of having listened to them obsessively the worst thing is it can happen with people a well for instance i fell out of love with my partner of year not because he wa n't the one but because i wa an obsessive asshole and the relationship started to become a burden and a routine now we 're just friend and i care about him a lot but i know my feeling for him will never be a strong a they used to be because that 's how thing work in my brain i go through similar phase with my hobby not being able to stick to something for a long time i used to play guitar and paint but they no longer bring me joy now this is how i am wired become slightly interested in something/someone become obsessed suddenly lose interest nbsp i am curious whether you can really rekindle love or not maybe you can with time ha anyone experienced this these are more recent example so maybe my feeling will change in a few year from now i do n't know what do you think is passion/love something you can rekindle with time or once you lost it you lost it for good,0

full disclosure opinion of an old fart with no relevant real world experience it seems that there is a reluctance to teach the essential of daily life of course those essential include personal finance social study art and world history hopefully those are covered some but the main thing that should be taught until it is at the forefront of every student 's analysis of everything is logical fallacy so much of the political discourse a well a people 's decision could be improved if everyone only understood how propaganda work but there is or seems to be a reluctance to analyze current event because doing so is controversial imagine if an english teacher went line by line dissecting a speech by the president of the u for logical fallacy sure within sentence the student would understand everything from ad populum to post hoc and be able to see through the propaganda but these day the parent would be up in arm arguing about how people are picking on their party or some garbage about loyalty or some such thing school should be a place to learn how to think analytically but it seems to be a place to learn how to avoid thinking at all at least if current political discourse is any indication,0

i 'm a naive piece of shit i wish i wa dead i ca n't cope with my failure or life in general why did i have to be born so slow why do i have to be socially anxious why is it that it is only when i feel completely defeated by life and have resolved to giving up literally taking up most of the day in order to process my own feeling that i even feel one iota of respect for the man in the mirror why is it only then that i have enough confidence to look myself in the face with any sort of dignity why is it only after all this nonsensical anguish that i am able to have any kind of respect for myself and lastly why is it that my confidence effortlessly drift away when i come back to my message and have to contact people reverting back to not knowing if what i 'm about to say is the best way to communicate what i mean despite not suffering from this kind of thing in the past honestly i think i fucked up my brain with drug i started smoking weed in junior year of high school these day enough research ha been done to show that marijuana use potentially effect the development of the brain when consumed regularly before one reach their twenty i 've done lsd six time and to be honest there 's no telling if i wa actually doing the real physically benign thing because it 's not the 60 anymore and my dumbass trusted people that the stuff wa real half of those time were definitely fake shit i also smoked k2/spice willingly for a string of month i 've taken diphenhydromine benadryl recreationally three different time and two of those time i actually blacked out you do n't know how scary it is to actually black out i 've also done dextromethorphan caught medicine recreationally six time total finally i ate an eighth of shrooms two year ago and it wa possible the worse experience i 've ever had in my life i debated going to the hospital the entire time and it felt like my brain wa literally physically imploding on itself for like an hour straight i still smoke weed to this day because honestly i think i may just have fucked my brain up for good i am too far gone now and the only thing i can really do with my life is struggle escape and i do n't really care what the effect of it are now weed is the only thing that provides any real pleasure any more yes i gain a lot of respect for myself when i take responsibility for my life but since i legitimately suspect i have become too unintelligent to the make the most of my work i am deeply afraid nothing will ever come of it or that i will have to struggle for a long time before reaching some kind of success for myself the fact that i struggled with community college and to this day am absolutely awful at the bare basic of communication to the point where i am never really sure how what i say is going to come across unless i think a ton about it i 'm afraid my drug abuse is the reason my face look dead all the time i 'm afraid it is the reason for my emotional blunting i mean god dammit before everything wa already said and done i could at least feel passionate about what got me down and cry about it i would be more willing to get my brain scanned and analyzed by neurologist if i wa n't legitimately terrified that i will end up finding out that i have burned deep hole into the left side of my brain or just completely fucked up my broca 's area or my whole frontal cortex in general i really do feel like i 've lost myself somewhere along the way and it 's too painful to have to carry this identity of not being sure of myself at all and not feeling like it 's actually realistic to expect anything great of myself which just really hurt because back when i wa a child i wa told i could do anything i set my mind to a lot of my self confidence wa actually rooted in this notion nowadays it seems like that is wholly untrue maybe i truly have incapacitated myself in some way it hurt to think about i already have enough problem taking it when my ego is knocked down a peg i know that i 'm a fuck up just let me die already,1

do you have a secret wish in my language there is this way of saying that literally translate to having a dream in the drawer an unrealized dream you kept for yourself something you wanted wished to achieve but did n't have i could n't find the right way to explain it since i have n't find a similar concept in the english language and got a little help from google this idiom mean that you have a dream not yet realized but that you can always hope it could come true and when you want to renew/revitalize your hope you have only to pull the drawer open and look at it and afterward you can push the drawer your dream will always be there waiting for you and you can keep thinking maybe someday,0

is it me or is reddit full of rather negative people i know there 's fair and positive people and subreddits like this but it seems a though a lot of the reddit population is completely miserably and intensely pessimistic i 'm not saying that you should ignore real problem and all that but it seems a though finding anything positive is just a sign of pure stupidity and ignorance i actually ran into a comment one day that said hope for the best expect the worse some reply even encouraged this mindset what 's funny is that i actually took a month-long break from reddit just to move away from this for awhile coming back i actually thought people took a chill pill since i 've left it seems a though everyone 's going back even r/jokes and r/showerthoughts have popular post revolving around this kind of mindset guess i wa wrong about my hope maybe that one comment i mentioned wa right about this please correct me if i 'm wrong on this observation,0
i suffer from diagnosed ocd and it s incredibly difficult for me to function university ha been absolute hell some day and my inability to make friend hasn t helped me make a support group either summer isn t a relief either a my ocd is free from worrying about school to make me absolutely hate myself and feel like i m a monster i thought my parent were sympathetic to my mental health even if they constantly upset me with their poor attitude towards me and themselves but my dad say i ll have to work at the job i had to quit early last summer if i don t find something while my mom is pressuring me to start job searching now right before midterm i thought they understood i thought they could put and together and realize that their son who only got permission to see a therapist in highschool when he said he felt suicidal might still feel the same way now i feel like my life ha nowhere positive to go and that the best year of my life are behind me i give them chance every time and think they understand but they either forget or just decide it s not that bad i wanted to get a therapist but i honestly feel nothing but self loathing and a desire to cut everything that make me happy out of my life,1

i 'm gon na miss my friend when we all graduate a little backstory i grew up in a poor family and i 've been through more than one rough patch a a teenager i got to pursue a higher education on grant and i can say with full confidence that my time at college ha been the best year of my life i 've learned so much experienced new thing sharpened my skill but best of all i 've made so many friend yesterday my friend and i all got together to make general tso 's stir fry i brought the ingredient but everyone else helped in their own way some of them helped prepare the food others brought utensil i wa missing and everyone kept a funny conversation going the food turned out great and we had so many ingredient left over that we decided to do it again today i wa writing about it in my journal after we finished cleaning up and it made me realize just how much i 'm going to miss them all once we 're all done with school i 've known them all since my second year we moved into the same quad cluster of room together and i 've been living with them for the past year i remember my roommate for two of those year would host tabletop rpgs for u like d d and they were even more fun than i ever could 've imagined them and anytime one of u wa in a bind we 'd all be willing to jump up and help out they 're all like family to me now some people say you do n't know you 're in the good old day until long after they 're gone but i 'm over here tearing up because i know that i 'm in the good old day and i 'm going to miss being here in college so much two of my friend are graduating this semester the others still have at least a year to go and i have one extra semester left so ha anyone else here ever been in the same boat made a tight-knit group of friend at college then separated after graduation what happened afterwards how did you cope moving on,0

my life wa going well then i fucked up my knee and now despite my successful past of coping with mental health issue i 've lost a lot of my hope in life i 'm and in august last year i got a meniscus removal for a tear i had i kept going to place to figure out why it still hurt and now month later one possibility that i 've heard is that i have another tear or a tear that wa originally there anyway they 're going in to fix it but either way there 's still a piece missing because of my knee i do n't go out much or walk a lot of long distance or get to the gym a much a i used to and i now have a very different perspective on how easily human can be broken a dumb a it may sound mortality is kinda staring me down lately i had to cancel a job i got over the summer because i have to take a few month to heal on crutch i 'm staying with family which i do n't know how i feel about but my real fear is that the surgery wo n't work and i 'll just keep getting worse unable to do all the other shit i used to do and that my year old friend can do hell shit my dad can do which is kinda why i think about killing myself because maybe i 'm already practically dead anyway,1
after year of doing absolutely nothing with my life i 'm looking at university course i mean i have been looking for job unsuccessfully and it 's not like i have n't thought about going back to school but i 've never actually looked into it the idea of student loan always kind of terrified me regardless of whether i can get help with them a i 'm pretty poor and i do n't have a solid idea of what i 'd want to do extend what i studied in college since i love the subject or do a different subject i love out of variety or do something more practical and bland that is more liable to lead to consistent employment afterwards all i know is it seems it would be better to spend the next three year studying something i enjoy with the chance for new experience followed by potential decade of nothing than just the decade of nothing anyone else have any experience going back to school anyone who 's been to college/uni wa the time and money worth it,0

i have no reason not to do it when i find the right rope then it 's light out i have no reason to live i 'm no job no friend just got into university with a shit score no license absolutely shit family all i fucking do all day is go on my phone and watch tv that 's all i 'm literally the most worthless useless piece of shit you can imagine i do n't matter to anyone i 'm a fucking failure seriously if i did n't get into university i would have already killed myself already i just got into it with a score well below needed i worked so fucking hard in year but still got a shit score i have depression too,1
i 've been depressed my whole life i wo n't get into the reasoning here because it is n't really relevant at year old i 've almost never been happy that all changed a few month ago when i started a new job i finally got my shit together started making money and even made a few friend a it turn out my friend group ha a second friend group it 's literally the same people minus myself plus one other person they have a chat group they go to dinner they watch movie etc i found out by accident and they are clearly hesitent and secretive about their activity outside work when i am nearby they must know how i would feel about it i 'm sure if one of them wa excluded they would feel the same way this is all bad enough but what 's worse is that a new guy just started at work i feel like he and myself got along quite well i would help him learn thing we 've eaten lunch a few time well a it turn out he wa recently added to the secret second chat group that excludes myself i ca n't stop thinking about it i thought i finally had some friend but i obviously care far more about them than they care about me for the first time in month i am drifting back into depression and suicidal thought i do n't know what to do if i say something then they will add me to their group out of pity and that is almost worse than being excluded altogether i should have known that happiness wa too good to be true edit thank you all so much for your comment and dm there are so many that it would probably take me a full day to properly respond the each of them but i have read through all of them it seems like a huge number of u have gone through similar experience at some point in our life it is n't fun but at least we suffer together what i really needed wa a place to vent and this wa clearly the place to do it,1
i don t want to scar my family and friend and somehow that guilt is strong enough to not make me end thing i often fantasize about getting very ill physically and having that excuse to not have to deal with life i know that s terrible but honestly it would make people near me more understanding i would also be able to pas away and everyone would be prepared to grieve i feel like feeling depressed since childhood isn t a very good start and honestly i m just not strong enough and i don t feel like it s worth it anyways because it will be like this for the rest of my life,1
sometimes i feel like people would appreciate my existence more if i were dead why is that,1

my mom 's friend i did not know at the time what had happened to me but it made me not socialize with other kid at school i remember the police being there and my parent being upset i remember

a different thought than most on here get your stuff tested or make sure whoever you get it from is a trustworthy friend or family member there is a chemical called 25i-nbome that is often sold a lsd but unlike lsd it can actually be physically dangerous so ideally you have it tested but if you can't/did n't and the tab taste bitter spit it out normal lsd should be tasteless,0
i do n't know if it 's even possible for child to have depression everytime i 've told a psych professional they 've laughed at me the thing is though i 've literally always been depressed like i hear people talk about how time were easier when they were younger and how they could go back to that time of innocence and all but i never had that maybe maybe in my first few year i wa moderately happy but from then on i 've always been depressed i just grew up too fast doe anyone else understand what i mean,1
this may be based on the wrong example but it wa caring for each other when we are all watching tv or sitting in the garden and one of u is getting a drink or snack we would ask if anyone else would also want some my sil wa a only child and she never doe that,0
someone i knew just texted me this when i decided to come clean and talked to my friend about my pdd and gad and to explain why i have gone mia for so long what am i supposed to make out of this statement i 'm confused edit this might not belong here but i 'm not quite sure where to go edit a little background of how this came about i wa in a slump for a whole month recently i stopped going to work i stopped contacting my family and friend i went in and out of hospital for cutting myself since i live alone and my nearest friend wa almost an hour away i avoided everyone in fear of burdening them to come and look for me but few close friend still came over and helped me to get back to reality and helped me to manage myself again and i 'm slowly getting better now during my slump a lot of my casual normal friend were asking and somehow accusing me of making excuse to just run away and avoid my responsibility so i came forward texted the group chat and explain about whatever happened to me and what i felt i mentioned that i wa n't expecting anyone to understand i just wanted to explain myself so they would stop making accusation then a friend texted that to the group chat and since last night the whole text wa left at that i did n't know what to respond so i just went to sleep feeling blank and a bit lost my close friend told me to just ignore because if the person do n't want to be around there are others who would be glad to help me a much a i need somehow i 'm kinda okay with it now after reading all your comment but i still wonder do you actually tell people about your depression at what point that you decided to tell then about it if you did n't tell anyone what make you decide that way,1
it 's way harder and take more energy to be with the wrong person than to be alone also my initial gut reaction to a situation is usually the right one,0
depression is an illness but how do i know i 'm not just a shitty person pretending to be depressed i do shitty stuff i knowingly make wrong decision and hurt people and i do n't change sound like a pretty shitty person to me,1

i 've dealt with depression for a long time before and for about the past nine month have been feeling a major improvement in both my anxiety and depression to the point where i 've thought my problem were solved the thing is though that now i feel perfectly fine and positive most of the time but relatively often have sudden intense mood swing where i feel like utter shit and seriously contemplate suicide even planning to do it and hurting myself i used to basically feel like shit all the time and never feel happy which is why i thought i no longer have depression am i still depressed or is this normal i 'm still on medication i do n't know what to do about this or is this just a normal thing,1

idkwtf2do homeless pregnant prostitute addict-give me an idea wtf to do first of all i 've gotten accusation of being a troll or a liar before when i 've reached out for help/advice in the past please if you think i 'm a liar just keep scrolling i am telling the god 's honest truth and i am looking for real support and advice i 'm very vulnerable right now and though i 'm used to being judged i do n't like it it 's a long story how i got here but here 's where i am right now i discovered i am pregnant day ago i already have a child but cps and my family agreed long ago that i am not fit to be a mother due to me having debilitating mental illness schizophrenia/bipolar/ptsd my husband and i discussed adoption but the end result of the discussion wa that we both agree i 'm not capable of even carrying a healthy pregnancy anymore due to exponentially compounded mental illness plus some fun and exciting brain damage ive been dealing with since i wa beaten and raped last august i also only have month clean off of a hardcore meth addiction and had full intention of going back to it before i found out i wa pregnant so there 's that risk oh yeah and also i 'm a prostitute or i wa a prostitute then that new law came into effect and craigslist and backpage got shut down yesterday so i guess i 'm a displaced sex worker i do n't have any regular since i just moved to this town temporarily last month my shit is shut down we just finally raised enough cash to move into a motel too we have a whole week paid in advance and if i worked hard i could have paid the rent and also put some aside for u to finally get a live-in vehicle within a couple month but with the main site shut down there 's no way i can get the traffic i need just to pay the rent we 're going to be homeless on thursday again sleeping on the ground hungry af getting woke up by cop carrying all our shit on our back dirty sweaty tired homeless i hate being homeless some people seem to think it 's a fun free lifestyle no dude it suck oh did i mention an abortion cost over even with financial assistance so on thursday i will be a homeless pregnant prostitute trying to raise a ridiculous amount of money for an abortion while dealing with demon in my head aching for drug and frequent fainting spell from a mix of pregnancy sickness brain damage and hunger plus like emotion and shit coz u know losing your job losing your home and having an abortion all suck separately this is all happening at one time i have been suicidal since i wa a little kid come with the territory of mental illness tried to do it way more time than i can count spent year in and out of mental hospital and program and psychiatrist and all the med they could throw at me before they took me off all the med and said good luck with life that wa last april since last june i 've been on sort of an anti-suicide mission i 've been trying to find a reason to live some semblance of that happy thing people talk about an hour straight where i do n't want to hurl myself off the nearest tall building and ive tried a lot of shit ive talked to a lot of people i even became a christian somewhere in all that the conclusion i came to month ago when my hail mary landed on the yard line wa that nobody is ever really happy and the best thing i can do is buckle up get comfortable and live my life waiting for the happy day i die i do n't want to commit suicide i just want to die so so bad more than anything else i just want the bullshit to be over so this notion of just trying to stay comfortable making the best of a bad situation is what 's gotten me through the past few month but now i 'm sick af all the time pregnancy brain damage dizziness headache fainting vertigo unbalanced equilibrium all experienced in the last fckn day knowing i 'm about to have to carry that big old 40lb backpack everywhere and give bjs to guy in their car for my normal rate so i can afford to end a pregnancy that p much anybody would agree need to be ended well shit that doe n't sound comfortable at all in fact it sound like it 's going to end very very badly for me ptsd compound even if i do manage to get the abortion somehow i still have to live my life a a complete fuck-up homeless ex-hoe bag lady a few day ago before all this shit happened i told my husband about an attempt i made in december he asked if i regretted my decision not to go through with it i tried to come up with something positive to tell him but the truth is i definitely unequivocally regret not pulling that trigger what about your family/friends i do n't have any my family stopped talking to me when i got into meth when i called them asking for help to get into a rehab my dad told me to kill myself my friend also disappeared when i got into meth obvs my meth-head friend wont talk to me now that i 'm clean all i have is my husband and even he agrees that jesus would probably forgive me for killing myself because shit 's that bad in my head all the time why do n't u get a real job i 've tried i 'm incapable psychiatrist and counselor have all told me i would never be able to hold a job support myself or even live independently and i tried really hard to prove them wrong apparently the only thing i 'm capable of doing on the daily is laying on my back my husband is currently working but only part time at minimum wage and it 's kind of a miracle that he 's able to do that a he ha his own issue i 've been up all night with racing thought all the pill we have here combined would n't do it plus my husband just woke up so any action will have to wait i 'm not desperately sitting here with a gun to my head but i 'm pretty damn sure like sure that i 'm going to get it done in a much of an idiot-proof way possible coz i hate failing at suicide almost a much a i hate being alive that i 'm going to get it done by thursday unless someone out there ha a better idea tl dr tell the homeless pregnant whore who cant even afford an abortion why she should go on with this miserable existence,1

i 'm a 20-year-old college student i do n't have a job my grade are average and i often do le than the bare-minimum to pas my class but i ca n't manage anything else right now it 's really hard to even get up and shower/change clothes i only have one class that i have to attend in person per day but i still skip class all the time i 've been much worse off which is probably why i still have n't sought help fuck senior year of high school i skipped day a week there wa garbage and broken glass pill bottle and alcohol stashed all over my room and i spent most of my day either staring at the ceiling from my bed cry or playing video game so yeah definitely been worse i 'm also not feeling suicidal which is definitely an improvement but i 'm still doing pretty badly even though i 'm not suicidal i 'm still not interested in life anymore and i 've been blowing everything off despite the consequence i party most day of the week and if i 'm not\ partying i 'm still smoking and drinking alone i ca n't really sleep unless i 'm hammered/high anymore i spend most of the day turning off alarm and staring at the wall or maybe doing a small amount of homework at the very last minute i 'm feeling really close to how i felt the quarter where i failed all of my class i 'm on academic probation and quite literally can not handle failing anymore class i 've already failed and i 'm only quarter in my school 's mental health service are laughable and over-saturated the last time i tried to talk to one of the counselor they told me that it would be at least a 1-month wait to get a general appointment at which time i would fill out a survey to determine whether or not i wa depressed enough to get therapy i 've tried off-campus too but the over-flow of student ha spilled over to all the therapist who accept my insurance the last time i called i wa promised that i would be put on a wait-list and if that 's to be believed then i 've been on or so wait-lists for month now i do n't have the strength to call more last year i did manage to get an appointment with a school therapist but she ended up 5150-ing me so i wa arrested and detained for hour but i never got therapy or treatment i went to a psychiatrist in my home town over the summer and got some antidepressant but i 've been out of the prescription for a while my last therapist is also in my home town and i have n't contacted him in several month i really desperately feel like i ca n't do this on my own but i do n't want to be hospitalized i think i might also be a high-functioning addict or have addictive tendency but i do n't want to be sent to rehab either but if i do n't do anything at all i feel like i will definitely fail my class i 'm already close to failing a few of them because of my lack of attendance and near inability to study/do work i think i need help but i ca n't find it anywhere it feel like no matter what i do shit 's about to hit the fan and my life is falling apart how can i get help,1

i genuinly have fucked over my future life over the last month hi long story short the love of my life told me she wa gay month ago and i spiraled into a deep depression sucking with it my good result in school i went from b s and a s to d s and e s i am worried that i will both fail my exam and not get into the field of study i have wanted to enter all my life i am absolutely devestated and don t see any way out life is not for me what the fuck do i do,1
i 've had a darkness gnawing at me for most of my life a sense of utter meaninglessness a i proceed through life i feel like there 's a void around me going through me working studying doing anything it feel so effortful and i feel so tired and nobody really care what i do at university my teacher never knew my name after university at work we 're all in our bubble nobody care about anyone when i fail nobody would pull me up rather the company will dump me a soon a i cease to be productive i 'm lucky in that my family care about me and i have or friend i keep going for them i ca n't really make myself happy in a real way but i can make them happy which give me some joy but most of the time they 're not around and a i get older we all drift in our separate self actualised direction i 've failed in all my attempt at forming a close intimate bond with someone else my personality and interest are so eccentric woman may find me interesting but they rarely love me and so in that respect i 've been alone for almost the last year i made a lot of effort in the last year i put much of my energy into it and i failed repeatedly i 've experienced pain boredom one-sided love but never reciprocated romantic love i 've only ever really wanted thing since i wa a teenager and that wa romantic affection everything else i 've done i did to make my family happy since then i 've tried to live hedonistically for myself and it 's brought me momentary relief from my thought but ultimately it doe little for me with my bed a screen and an internet connection there is little else i can buy so my money pile up unspent what 's the point in suffering through work for employer who view me a an expense item for money i spend le than half of i used to think i wa saving for my family 's future but the prospect of that ever happening for me feel more distant a the year go by i 'm now and i do n't even know how to hold hand with someone else even something that small loom large in my fantasy i 'm unemployed right now and thinking about the future but i have no energy to go back to work it all feel pointless i could go another year or two like this on my saving but then what i 'm materially blessed if only due to my frugality but i ca n't help but feel the gnawing nothingness when life feel lifeless what reason is there to delay death,1
i 've suffered with depression all my life i wa raised by narcissistic parent and spent most of my life feeling alone and like i did n't fit in my wife wa the same and when we found each other we found more than a spouse but someone who could relate i ca n't describe my love for her we complete each other around year ago she wa diagnosed with ovarian cancer for the second time at age whilst she wa pregnant with our daughter we lost our daughter to stillbirth but my wife somehow pulled through had chemo and got an all-clear during this time both of our family proved themselves to be thoroughly selfish useless and downright nasty so we both went no contact and it wa the best thing we did after four year of healing we got married and life seemed to be getting on track last month i took my wife to a e because she wa passing out and having trouble getting her blood sugar under control only for them to tell u after a few more test that despite having no ovary left the cancer had returned somehow spread to her lung and liver and there is next to nothing they can do she is due to start chemo soon and is in an awful lot of pain she ha been prescribed morphine for it but due to that spends most of the time sleeping while i sit here and watch over her making sure she is ok. the trouble is i ca n't talk to her about any of this it 's too painful for her to do anything but ignore at the moment but i 'm devastated and alone besides how i feel should be the least of her worry at the moment and i do n't want to put that on her i feel like i 'm already grieving her even though she is still here i 'm completely alone with no-one to lean on for support i 've already lost so much and i do n't know how i am going to cope when i 'm here alone i feel like i 'll probably just see out my cat life and then take my own nothing feel worth doing if i ca n't share it with her,1
what do you do to get yourself out of a funk i 've been super depressed lately drowning myself in work pushing people away and just hiding in my home for a few week now been going out occasionally but it just doe n't feel right i could use suggestion on what other people do to get out of a funk or just some nice distracting conversation,0

i 'm done i have spent most of my life trying not to hurt anyone by ending my life i am have enormous amount of student dept that i ca n't pay because i ca n't find work and basically i am a burden on my family i 'm alone in this life my child are grown the last time i tried to have a relationship he like the others abused and tried to kill me and basically i live in my dead parent house and have to bow down to my sister and ask permission to do anything i ca n't even choose where to put the cat litter box just because i 'm not a pretty and successful a my sister i am apparently stupid to so i am going to take myself and my unwanted cat out of the equation yes people will hurt for a day or two but reality is once your gone everyone go on and you are quickly forgotten and when you are like me and everyone forgets about you on the regular anyway it wo n't take anyone any time at all to get over me no there is no help to get the dept off my back because if you are in default there is no option other than to come up with and make payment on time you do n't go into default if you can make the payment so the most ridiculous thing ever i ca n't go on disability because of the loan and i ca n't work because i am a sick broken mess and so we go to sleep now and the unwanted are crossing the rainbow bridge good bye,1

i just want to make it stop all of the trivial stressor in my life- work relationship health family- people think these are what ail me and that i m overreacting my life is a bit fucked up but in the scheme of thing is something to be grateful for and on the outside ha all the answer laid out for me and the potential to be a functional human should be there but what they don t understand is none of that matter to me no matter how much i try the going on in my life itself good or bad are merely fodder for a greater pain just crumpled up newspaper thrown in the fire that burn up in a flash into smoldering ash the pain they inflict are just the spark that spit from the bigger flame the real problem is so much harder to understand than that and impossible to explain- i try to grasp some form of sense out of reality time life death loneliness love good and evil- i am suffocating in an inferno of confusion my flesh is burning alive inside and manifest a psychosomatic pain that leaf me incapacitated i don t know who i am what i want or why i m here i can t make any sense of the past present future- i m lost i m lost i don t know if i m truly alive or if anything or anyone is real my thought make no sense other people make no sense i can t find any way to communicate my feeling i feel like i m in a straight jacket and locked in a metal box in the center of this fire that s burning out of control i can t attach any meaning or feeling to anything everything is either pain or complete disconnection which is somehow even more painful on the outside i m a whiny pest who is quietly losing my mind for no good reason on the inside i can t stop screaming into the void of absurdity one day i m going to drink myself stupid swallow a bottle of seroquel slit my wrist and wander naked into the wood to bleed out in a river and pray with all my might to no one that nothing exists for me after death that s the only thing i fear more than life itself the only desire left inside of me is for silence nothing else give me any relief from this agony please god give me silence give me a sign that if i die this will really be over and i won t be condemned to any kind of continued consciousness i need to be sure this is really the end i can t take it anymore,1
like seriously mabye i would actually succed relatively in my study actually have a couple of friend i could hold on to actually have something worth living for if it wa not for all the shit you get from staying inside and stacking up a shit ton of problem in your head at the same time i would be happy just having one good friend living a mediocre life aint nothing wrong with that it 's just you keep hindering yourself with all the crap pentup in your head when i point this out i 'm sure a lot of you guys/gals can sympathize with this difficulty when it come to social interaction it 's so goddamn hard unless i 'm speaking to my family/a nice psychologist i seriously ca n't keep the act together i become this shell of a person not knowing what to do and feel not being able to feel like a real person and not knowing what kinda person you are yourself really hinders anything you do whether it 's just in your head or whatever it 's very real for u i think u in particular are the world most untapped resource i hope everybody in the world will someday find a cure to this utter paralysing state that is depression in combination with the extra package which come for free yay free shit edit it 's always nice to know you are not alone so for that i am grateful but the fact that a lot of people feel similar/the same a me make me really sad it 's a terrible state of being and i really wish the best for you guy out there i really think someday this hurdle will become a walk in the park and all of u will achieve that which we want,1

tripping on acid is great you see youre own reality in kind of a 3rd person perspective like you ll have a normal thought but simultaneously think why am i having that thought very therapeutic in that aspect you get this whole new set of emotion that are beautiful and or scary an lsd trip is the one time that i cry and laugh at the same time the music shiver are 10x better on acid when i listen to a song sober i might get head tingle on acid it my whole body that go numb and of course it make you see thing that arent there mainly colour and random pattern distortion that turn into fractal when you focus on it but it the mindset thats truly beautiful,0

i hate my life this is my first post on reddit i ve always read through reddit but never thought it would come to the point where i would actually create an account and post on reddit so anyways i m a year old male turning in month and i just hate my life right now i have no job i have some friend but there not really my friend cause they never include me in their plan and even though they act cool around me i could tell they could give fuck if i m out of their life my brother wa recentally kicked out of my apartment by my dad because my dad drink everyday after work and one day he snapped about it to him and my dad kicked him out it s not just that though my dad ha never really been a good dad he ha always been in and out of me and my brother life and whenever he wa out it wasn t for nothing serious and it would be for his own selfish reason there s been multiple time where we needed him where we lived in the ghetto with no water and electricity dirt poor and even then he didn t show up and he even had a kid with some year old in brazil that he denies is his but i m pretty sure it is his and life ha been getting even worse because i don t think i m gon na graduate high school cause my gpa is low and i overheard my dad saying on my 18th birthday he s gon na kick me out to so that just make me paranoid and feel worse there s even been multiple friend that my dad kicked out of his life that claim he s been doing cocain so now i really can t trust him and my mom can t help me either don t get me wrong she s one of the few that care about me but she s suffered with anxiety and depression her whole life and recently lost her job after not having one for year before that so i don t think she will be getting one anytime soon and my grandma also life with u but she ha disability and only get her retirement check which is only enough for one person to live so if she get kicked out to she can t worry about u so now you can see that after high school i basically meet a dead end to my life i ve envisioned what my future will look like and i can only come up with either homeless or dead and i ve just been really depressed lately thinking about it and i never thought it would come to this point but i m actually contemplating suicide it s crazy that i m even thinking about it because i have always been strong and told myself no matter what happens in my life i will not resort to suicide but i ve reached my breaking point i ve even given up my belief in god because i ask myself if he wa real why can t he just make everyone have a good life or atleast just pop up for second to let u know he is here so yea a time keep going i have no job dead broke dad doesn t care about me on the road to not graduate high school friend that don t care about me on the verge of being kicked out and being homeless and one big thought of suicide so there you go any response will help but i don t know how much longer i can make it,1

not doing well feeling like i 'm alone on eggshell afraid to talk to anyone my life is a mess that 's the best possible way to summarize my current ordeal a mess a complete and totally fucking chaotic mess a long a i can remember shit just started going wrong for me i 'm not talking like i had hard time at school i mean i did but this is n't daddy did n't hug me i got a flat tire or lost my job stress this is a glitch a glitch you ask well some guy once told me he believed in a path predestiney and that if we went off that path the world universe or whatever bullshit abstract deity you want to call it would then ratify said issue until you were back on track at first the romantic notion of this appealed to me it made me hopeful i assume probably the same pathetic way people cling to an indifferent god that allows child rape serial killer and mass war to go on thing so bad the only thing to keep up from losing what we call humanity is to think it all must have some greater meaning i 'm here to tell you the unfortunate uncomfortable and brutal fucking truth bad shit happens because bad shit happens. there is no greater plan no god no destiny and nothing at the other end of a gun then a void of thoughtless empty black nothingness now i 'm sure you think i 'm jaded and fuck you re probably not wrong but the other thing is it doesn t mean i m necessary wrong here either i grew up on the usaf base my mom cheated on my dad every chance she had there wa a decent debate about if i wa his kid for a while since he wa in korea when it seemed i wa created my dad got out and began to travel with the railroad leaving me behind with my sibling who were all from different men and a psychotic mother who to her credit loved me the best she could that s just not saying much not much at all if you re a small defenseless child my brother would rape my sister and i. i 'm lucky enough this wa in my infant year and i didn t find it out until i wa teen when i asked why he wa kicked out my mom would cheat and she would beat me if i accidentally let word slip mention of thing like the motel she made me and my sister sleep in a 2nd bed next to hers while she screwed a guy and my dad wa traveling five year old and more confused than ever i mentioned our vacation because that s what she called it and took a 20z liter bottle of pepsi to the side of my head and then wa held under the bath tub water eventually i wa seen a liability to her she began locking me in the entryway closet and leaving me there for hour i made it into a fort and convinced myself it wa my hiding spot even though it wa tied shut from the other side time went on and my dad finally made my mom get a job while that went on and i wa still before school age i went to a babysitter house long long story short i wa lucky enough to find myself being put into child porn with his daughter nicole my year old babysitter meanwhile him and his son set up camera in her room and i wa raped with a aladdin barbie doll amongst other mcguvery rape child s toy they could think of certainly life would get better from here right i mean predestiney the fucking path right surely i wasn t destined to a life of only suffering wrong my dad and mom divorced and my dad remarried to a very abusive psych-nurse that loaded my already alcoholic father up on benzos like fucking candy at one point i counted different medication i wa on it wa hell my dad developed a creepy and unhealthy obsession with my weight and appearance my stepmom wa fuming with jealousy about my dad and i maintaining any type of relationship and overtime and many drug convinced him i wa a verbal abuser that inherited mental illness from my mother and i couldn t be trusted they punished mostly through shaming my first date with a boy ever i woke up and found our house covered in post it that say abuse will can not be tolerated abuse will not be tolerated i wa i ran around hysterically pulling them down i missed the one behind the curtain of the window obviously that relationship dead ended by the time i turned i saw my out and joined the army… surely free of the source of pain the real world would be much kinder also fucking wrong it 's all a miserably long and uncomfortable situation to recall but it end with several assault and rape and a baby later but that wa it my win my one good in all the bad her my flawless pure unruined baby girl an even longer story later a wealthy creepy and obsessive man manages to have her taken from me i raised her alone for of the year she s been alive and he got her money can win court case sorry kid but these aren t the book they read you in school right and wrong and good guy bad guy mean shit in the real world money is power and money is how you win so i end up trying to kill myself a few time which i think is fairly fucking justified at this point in the game i 've been homeless hungry raped and abandoned from the moment i had formative memory and so there i go off to inpatient at the va hospital for ptsd that s when i met him a fucking light at the end of this miserable tunnel of bullshit a fucking glimmer of hope at the end of a phone he s sarcastic witty and rough around the end he s perfect and he fed me story of promise for hope of a life with living and no surviving he tell me there is an end and there is a reason to let my heart keep beating and just like that month later this wonderful although complicated and bit of a pain in the as man show up from afghanistan at the mpls airport to rescue me from the hell hole i 've been drowning in the first moment he hugged me i knew i wa finally safe for the first time since birth i wa safe because he had me i didn t need to look over my shoulder and i didn t have to wonder about if happiness for me wa even an option it wa a very real possibility and so i married him and it wa the best day of my life now i know looking at my history that s not saying much but i imagine what i felt that day is what most normal people hope their entire life to feel it wa like all the pain and all the bad poured down into this moment him him and me and we were so perfectly fucked up together the rest of the world and it rule didn t matter we had each other and there wa nothing else either of were ever going to need or want again because it wa all there at least that wa how i felt i 'm sure it unsurprising to anyone at this point that trust is n't exactly my strong suit and i 've been forced into the position of choosing between a future with a life with this man and living under the wealthy scary man and being able to see my daughter every week it s pretty much the hardest situation i ve faced yet and clearly that s saying something and now today the light the hope this man he isn t even sure if he think i m worth it all and he s far from the first to look at me and all that is me and think maybe it would just be better to pas pas to someone le damaged le sad le scared confused complicated i honestly couldn t hold it against him and now here i sit looking back at my life and wondering if i m not that glitch i mentioned if maybe there is a god or entity or something and it goal is to erase the mistake it made and that s why i m being tortured so hopefully i ll kill myself and set everything back in order or maybe it s all fucking meaningless and all the suffering wa just a shitty role of the dice,1

i just want to start off by saying that mental illness doe n't discriminate when it chooses it victim i am just speaking from my perspective in no way am i saying that my mental health struggle are harder than people who come from a different racial background but it is difficult when you come from a community that stigmatizes and fails to recognize mental health a a real issue from my personal experience and those of other black people i know majority of u grew up being told that we 're being ungrateful weak crazy or sad for no damn reason i am sure that other people have been told these thing a well but this is all too prevalent in the black community recently i have sought out professional help after experiencing a mental breakdown on campus i wa extremely grateful to be paired with an understanding psychologist after the school year ended i came back home and had told my parent of my experience with this doctor and exclaimed how much he helped hoping it would change their mind about going to a doctor but they shot down the mere thought that anything outside of the bible could help me the claim that going to doctor is what the 'world doe they 're pretty religious all they want to do is put people on pill that is the furthest thing from the truth not once did the man i met with suggested that i be placed on any sort of medication and even if i were i would be willing to if i needed it i hate that i am nothing like my family if i believed in god they would be more accepting of me but i am at the point in my life where i feel that i want to believe in what feel right for me i want to be my own person not who anyone else want me to be i just wish that my parent and other black people who still hold on to the same mentality could just open their mind to the fact that acknowledging mental health is not a bad thing update i thank and commend all of you for sharing your experience in the comment in the place of african-american i originally had person of color because i am aware that this problem is very relevant within other group this wa basically me speaking from personal experience and you all have definitely opened my eye to what other group endure stay strong everyone no matter where you come from no matter what you look like your problem do not deserve to be invalidated or told they are not real i am proud of you all,1
my addiction therapist recommended i should talk to a psychiatrist in order to get medication for my depression the main issue i have is my lack of motivation and my litlessness i am able to feel happiness and joy in different situation but i also can be quite melancholic and pessimistic from time to time i have no thought about suicide but sometimes i like to imagine how thing would be if i were dead i am not sure if i want to talk to a psychiatrist because i already know he or she would like me to take med i am very sceptic about medication especially because of my addiction background but also because of negative side effect people who have experience with different type of antidepressant would you recommend to try it out or do you think the side effect could be worse than my moderate depression symptom,1
i do n't know what the hell life is anyway i just think with everything that 's happened i never stood a chance i 've always reacted horribly because of it you 're supposed to accept having to spend the rest of your life healing but i do n't see any point in living if you are being constantly tortured and if everything ha been severely delayed and destroyed i 'm also sick of people with normal childhood and loving parent saying it will get better a if they understand i feel like i have nothing to offer and therefore no one would care if i died i keep feeling like whenever i post here i sound so self-pitying and pathetic but what the hell i have no idea what life is supposed to be full of anyway and in the end it feel like if anyone tried to reassure me then they may a well be telling a mouldy corpse that it ha potential if your family 's never given a shit then who can,1

i want to be dead i am year old and have been dealing with suicidal thought since around middle school i dropped out of high school in the beginning of my 11th grade year for a few reason one of them being that i wa planning on killing myself soon after it ha been about year since then i have been hospitalized for mental health reason twice in that time there is so much that i could write about and i find no real reason not to write about a much a i can what 's the worst thing that can happen nobody read it i 'm so young there are so many thing that i can do with my life so why is it that i want for it to end so badly i believe in my ability and my strength to get better and to be better yet it doe n't seem to matter to me all that much sure right now i 'm not in such a great spot i 'm experiencing agoraphobia-level anxiety severe apathy and i stopped taking my prescription medication some week ago because i got frustrated with not feeling any better after month and month of experimenting with different combination prescribed by my psychiatrist i stopped seeing my counselor too i feel a if i were to kill myself any time soon there will be people who blame the fact that i stopped treating my mental illness it 's frustrating but i accept it there may be people who will discount my suicide a irrational and/or impulsive i believe there will be people who will question my sanity it 's all beyond upsetting but i 've been around long enough to know that preoccupying myself with what people think and say is a waste of time i 'm not in control so if i am sane and it 's not the lack of medication why do i want to kill myself it 's kind of funny to me really how calm i am i 've thought about killing myself so much that it 's normal for me i 'm not hopeless i 've just made up my mind i 've made my decision that i want to be dead not because i think misery is inescapable but because i think dealing with misery is inescapable i 've made the decision that i do n't want to keep taking on all the thing that life ha to offer not even for all the good thing because sometimes even the good thing stress me out i 'm tired of being stressed out i do n't want to deal with it i want to escape it i already know i 'm capable of dealing with stress in a healthy way i just do n't want to i know that maybe with time healthy coping mechanism could become like second nature to me it doe n't matter i do n't want to work at it i do n't i 'm tired i 'm tired of dealing with thing what i want is to not deal with thing everything i still have thing that give me joy i still have thing i want to do i have place i want to go thing i want to make book i want to read i 'm tired though i 'm tired of being awake i 'm tired of wanting i 'm tired of doing i 'm tired of being to keep on living requires energy that i do n't have i do n't want to be better i want to be dead it doe n't matter what counselor i see or what medication i 'm on i will never get better if i never try and i do n't want to try anymore committing suicide scare me because i am scared of what come after both for me and the people who care about me i am scared of failing to kill myself and destroying my body and/or mind i am scared i am scared of all the thing that could be if i were to keep on living but what scare me the most is what i will go through if i were to keep on living i am scared of struggling and i do n't think i would ever believe that there can be a life for me without struggle i could learn to manage those fear i could learn not to be so scared of the future and what it may bring i could learn to avoid thinking about killing myself when i get stressed out i could get better i could be better i could be healthier and i could be happier but i do n't want that i want to be dead,1

i brainwash myself to believe i don t have depression long post i m a high school student grade specifically mentally i always believed i wa a very healthy person i lived in a good home and have many friend though starting second semester feb of this year i started to go through episode of anxiety and depression this happened because of the amount of work i have to go through and several health problem sleep problem type diabetes i often feel like a burden to everyone because of how much i make them go through because of my diminishing body and my lack of ability to be logically-mathematically intelligent let me start with what happens at home and how it lead to everything like i said before i live in an amazing home and a loving family but the problem with them is a lot to do with their background they re immigrant and though i m sure they know of depression i believe they won t take me seriously when they watch the news and a report of a teen committing suicide come up they always tell me to talk to them if i ever had the thought they always try to ask me how my life is going because they want to know i m not going out of control when i started to experience a spiral in my emotion i wanted to approach them but i always stopped myself they re not from here they don t speak perfect english they can t comprehend what you re going through they ll just tell you off. those are just some of the thought i have whenever i think about telling them stripping the connection between my episode and letting them know what s going on severely influenced me to keep everything under the rug from my family this made me think this is only my situation and that they shouldn t know or else i ll just be told i m overthinking. secondly i m extremely young i always tell myself you re in high school not even a sophomore and you re seriously going through this i make myself believe that for someone my age i should focus on doing my homework and having a social life to add on people my age my school specifically shun those with depression people at my school make it seem you re one of those weird kid the tumblr sjws if you come out with depression a much i say don t judge people obviously i still want a reputation of being healthy and caring i hate myself for that so i bury my emotion in fake smile towards everyone when i really think of just leaving this place lastly i brainwashed myself to make my reason sound stupid if you read before i said i have depression because of my inability to keep up academically and disappointing everyone i also gained it from feeling like a burden to my family and even doctor because of my illness i make myself think others always have it worse you re being scolded by your biology teacher because you don t know how to dihybrid cross and you have depression because of that seriously is what i ll say i just feel like i m never good enough i will never be good enough my family won t have to waste a dime on me if i m dead my doctor won t have to care if i m dead my teacher won t have to worry about failing a stupid student if i m dead my friend won t hear me complain and annoy them if i m dead tldr i need help and i have no idea how to make myself stop thinking the world would be better if i m not here i continually say others have it worse and nobody would think it s a legitimate reason why i should be depressed i can t stop saying nobody will understand/care and that i m just an over-thinker because boy my age should be doing school work and not complain until they get to the real world,1

there 's no greater smell than that of spring hey reddit hope you 're all doing well i 'm just sitting here in bed with my window open a crack for the first time since last fall it 's still relatively cold where i live but i just realized like i do every year how much i missed the smell of spring i ca n't really explain it perhaps dirty musty metallic a bit i 'm sure there 's some scientific explanation behind it organic chemistry that lead to certain smell whatever it is it smell so nice that i wish i could bottle it up and wear it a a perfume it 's the kind of smell that rekindles a bit of hope in me a sense of thank god winter 's over and the feeling of good thing to come am i weird for thinking there 's a distinct scent to season or have you noticed the same thing what do the different season smell like to you how do they make you feel,0

extreme suicidal thought i don t want to go into the detail of what ha been giving me these thought to the extreme because it give me anxiety and i can t even play some game and be around some people because it reminds me of the person who caused this so if i m being honest this is really affecting me so i guess i ll say this my name is morgan i m a year old girl and i started self harming i don t want people to say you re to young to know what depression is or something like that because i ve been going through it for year i am fully aware that self harm isn t good but that doesn t mean just because you say stop it mean i m going to magically stop ya i m but that doesn t mean i should get judged for my problem i m saying all this because many many people seem to not understand how mental health work but off to the topic i suppose i started to self harm last month or maybe by now i can t remember but not that long ago it started out with just scratching my arm without stopping into cutting i started to scratch myself with a way to help with my emotion at the time i wasn t actually a depressed a now i wa with the said person who caused said problem and they made me happy foolish thinking back on it then after said person decided he wanted me to hate him he did a lot that mentally just destroyed me i wasn t myself at all i started to want to kill my self and i started to cut myself with scissors even just thinking about this all is already giving me anxiety but if i also got into a relationship with someone who i m not saying anything about but he is the only reason i try to not cut myself a lot even today i had a breakdown in school and i ve had way to many over the past week that i know i m definitely not ok,1

not acutely suicidal but noncommittal and detached about living or dying i 'm 25/male this is a bit of a ramble so apology in advanced i 've attempted several time especially during my first and only semester at university since my early 's though i 've just been 'meh taking a detached feeling towards life i 've never held a steady job i 'm legally unable to drive due to vision issue i have many 'minor disability and i 'm very overweight i ca n't recall ever being at a normal weight at any age i guess part of my problem is that i judge myself before i let others judge me i 've always felt self conscious since i wa in elementary school that i have this awkward aura or that people tend to overestimate my disability i 've always hated thinking of myself a 'disabled since i 'm not that disabled the resource i 'm eligible for should go to someone that need it more another thing i 'm self conscious of a of late is how much i might be like my father in prison since i wa for violent crime i wo n't go into especially a my temper seems to be getting shorter the more i realize just how much of a general failure i am i did n't have the best start and i 've made some shit decision i wa a horrible person when i wa a teenager often i 'm asking myself if i 'm a decent person that 's made mistake or if i 'm a sociopath with a conscience or something resembling a conscience i do n't see the selfishness argument a one that often work but i feel like i 'm just here until my family tie all but disappear i have a hard time seeing myself marrying or starting a family let alone reaching old age part of me just want to go several thousand mile from here and do something new though lack of driving ability a degree in which to secure job opportunity abroad and being broke in general seems to put a grinding halt on that so i 'm at a point where there 's nothing really stopping me from suicide except for the idea of who it effect i 've got my whole life to make it a 'clean a possible,1

welp i discovered last week that i got into a top-choice college it wa amazing i 'd gone on a string of rejection for a while and wa really beginning to doubt myself but to see myself get into this particular school it wa a euphoric feeling to say the least but then i got the financial aid package i 've pretty much accepted that i wo n't be attending this school but it 's a gut-punch all of this work and even more continual work to raise the fund and it still wo n't be enough i 'll admit i spent three day straight cry over this it 's all been for nothing i 've asked anyone if there 's any sort of way short of a miracle to raise the money i need but there really is n't it 's a if everything i 've been doing these past few year of my life were just four year that i wa pursuing the wrong thing it 's just i know this is extreme but i 've just lost a will to live i have grappled with suicidal ideation before but never ha it felt this intense before they come and go in wave so to speak and usually in very stressful situation for me i 've always been able to work through it i just get the feeling this is going to be a longer wave than usual special thanks for reading my vent i do believe i will be able to get through this a well but at the same time i wish i 'd just been rejected altogether from the school rather than accepted and unable to afford it i 'd probably have been able to move on easier considering that this wa my final decision following a string of rejection,1

my experience being suicidal i developed my depression when my social anxiety got out of control all my life i 've struggled with anxiety even back when i wa extremely young i struggled to make friend and attend a public school my anxiety got so bad to the point where it made me physically sick and i 'd usually end up vomiting every morning i lost immense amount of weight this way one high school hit it developed out of control being in a school with over other teenager wa too much for me to bear i got sick every day i missed class and eventually just could n't show up my doctor told me the best option for me wa to go on a hospital homebound program until my anxiety wa under control i started on new medication and meeting with new therapist many of which helped me for quite awhile when i left public school i lost contact with most of my friend i felt isolated from my family my friend and those whom i cared deeply about both my parent worked all day and came home late my mother wa also an alcoholic and drug abuser at the time even though i did n't know it and my older brother wanted nothing to do with me i wa alone all day every day eventually i felt so isolated alone and sad for so long that i could n't remember whom i once wa i could n't remember a time where i did n't feel sad i forgot how i used to act the thing i once enjoyed doing no longer brought me happiness i stopped caring about everything my grade slowly starting slipping a i wa not motivated and did n't care enough to worry about them i planned to end my life i wa a disappointment to my parent i never felt like i wa enough i would end up starving myself to be skinnier and occasionally throwing up my meal because i worried about gaining weight i felt a if i had no one i wa alone i cut myself what wa the point in living if you ca n't share a life with others what wa the point in living if you were always alone always living a life on repeat never feeling any different i cried until there were no tear left until i wa numb i had watched a movie about a girl who attempted suicide one day when i wa alone that day i planned to kill myself i cried and my nose bled but i did n't bother dealing with it i sat in a puddle of my own blood and stared at a wall for what felt like hour i wa so mind-numbingly afraid i said goodbye to the one person who seemed to care about me the girl who to this day i owe everything to she begged me not to do it she called me and messaged me begging me not to go i had a handful of prescription pill and i put them in my mouth i had researched earlier to see how much i needed to kill myself and i had the right amount i held those pill in my mouth covered in my own blood shaking cry and screaming while my friend wa messaging and calling me like crazy i ended up swallowing some of the pill not enough to kill myself though i pushed myself to get up and clean myself up if i could n't continue living for myself i have to continue living for her i cleaned everything up and once everyone came home that night it wa if nothing happened i still feel the urge constantly to end my own life i still do n't know who i am or who i used to be i 'm still alone and isolated i still cut myself i 'm still hurting and scared but i 'm still here i 'm not too sure why either and i 'm not too sure how much longer i 'll be here because one of these day i 'm going to be brave enough to do it,1

my second time posting here why do i even bother i think i deleted my last post because of how much it humiliated me i 've consider wether or not to kill myself every day for the past four+ year i spent nearly three year in an abusive relationship emotionally abused daily recodvif nothing but a torrent of bullying and humiliation from my ex i wa constantly made to feel grotesque for being half white if i yelled back i 'd be pushed or get a slap to the face sometimes he 'd break my thing in front of me my entire life wa dedicated to taking care of him i felt humiliated and degraded we never had any physical or romantic contact he 'd never say anything positive to me and towards the end he 'd address me in male pronoun only woman who were fully asian were considered actual woman to him i think about it every day he wa so sweet to me at first he wa my best friend in the whole world and after a year of a very platonically loving friendship i decided that i wanted to be in a romantic relationship i loved him deeply and wanted to be his wife within around nine month of our relationship he turned on me and the abuse only got worse from there we broke up two year ago and i 've been alone since then i started working from home last august and i 've been afraid of social interaction i only leave to go to the gym or get grocery and i do n't talk to anyone i do n't trust anyone else anymore and i 'm scared everyone see me a an ugly monster i 'm alone in this apartment most of the time i have n't had a friend in a couple year i lost them while in my last relationship i 'm so lonely every minute of the day i 'm reminded that i 'm le of a person because of my race i wish i wa never born i 'll never be happy again i miss my family i hardly get to see them my mother brother do n't live nearby my father died ten year ago in two month my mother is having major surgery done i 've looked into it and there 's over mortality rate for woman her age significant complication if she died i 'm ending my life without hesitation,1

every week i buy a packet of strawberry bon bon 's from the same shop because i did that every week when i wa and i associate the flavour and the smell with coming home from school excited to spend the weekend playing video game i buy an energy drink every wednesday because that wa the night i used raid with my old wow guild best time of my teenage year and every wednesday i had an energy drink alongside me i 'll probably do it tomorrow too i stay up until 5am regularly because i long to feel like i did when i wa and i remember staying up watching old movie i 'd never seen before i no longer get that sense of awe i used to eat pizza from the same place because i used to do it with my old band the only place we ever went to and whenever i eat there i feel like i 'm back in those day occasionally i walked the same route home that i did in high school so i can fantasise about getting home to talk the girl i fancied on msn that wa a decade ago though msn doe n't exist she 's moved on and i do n't have anything to look forward to the pizza place shut down recently new management who ca n't make pizza worth shit i fucking cried because i felt like that part of my life wa finally gone i wondered if in year i 'd be doing the same thing but to re-live the memory i 'm making now i do n't know if i will depression ha successfully taken away my ability to make new memory now my old one are becoming harder to hold on to edit hey everyone i woke to an overwhelming response thank you all for kind word advice and for sharing your own tale of nostalgia this is a hard subject for me i look forward to the future but the past is special and i never want it to go away entirely i 'm not one for unique experience the memory i have were never holiday or the first time i kissed someone or when i left high-school but rather a broad feeling because at some point there wa a part of my life that wa really good and even though doing it once wa fun doing it over and over and over again cemented it into my head a a source of overwhelming positivity hopefully by making broader improvement to my life they 'll start to form again i 'll continue to read the comment for a long a this post remains relevant thank you if anyone else is trying to get one over on depression too i 'm right along with you,1

on facebook i just unfriended a friend from high school cuz i could n't deal with the constant reminder of high school and my experience a a teenager he wa n't even a bad kid he wa n't my closest friend ever but just seeing his activity and what he wa doing kept reminding me of how i became depressed a a teenager and how it continues to plague me to this day i keep telling myself what i did wa ok because if those negative feeling are coming from something like that it 's ok for me to block it out but part of me is absolutely disgusted in how i ca n't even read social medium without the feeling resurrecting themselves,1
when i 'm actually genuinely happy or enjoying myself i still ca n't escape feeling so down i ca n't help but catch myself and remember that it 's only temporary that i 'm depressed and that this moment will end and i 'll be sad again just like it 's always been i wa talking with my family a few day ago they were playing board game drinking goofing around i had my little niece in my lap playing with my skirt the christmas decoration were still up it wa loud but everyone wa happy i wa happy but i wa still so sad i still smiled a everyone talked but i just felt like cry i do n't know what wa wrong with me i wa the happiest i wa in a long time i had every reason to smile but it wa n't real i just felt like i wa about to break down it 's so stupid i do n't know why i 'm like this why am i so screwed up how do i tell my stupid mind to just be happy it should n't be this hard i do n't want this just please let me be happy,1
inaction not sure if it count 's a being explicit about method but the mod will figure out i guess something that wa becoming more and more appealing to me a of late if i 'm so mentally fucked i ca n't do anything productive to sustain life then i do n't really need to kill myself biological and economical principle will do it for me no mess and rarely do people shame or mourn those who die of poverty those just wither away both from reality and from memory the problem is though i do n't have any money i did n't ever have any money that were mine a i 've always been supported by my mother and here is the thing i 'd rather die of starvation in the comfort of my home now than on the street some uncertain amount of time later when my mom wo n't be able to support me anymore but if i just tell my mother straight away that i 'm not going to eat today she wo n't understand after enough skipped meal she will probably send me to a psych ward yet i ca n't afford a place to stay alone for any lenght of time really what do what do,1

i ve yet to find a reason for having kid that isn t some spinoff of our selfish genetic code telling u to have a kid of our own i had one solid argument going in and it wa n't that consider procreation is the fundamental phenomenon that allows for the existence not only of our specie but of biological life itself an insane amount of humanity 's philosophy and value that we take for granted derives from that insight-by-proxy is always second-best i can imagine spending day on mar but whatever insight i can gain from a though experiment will fall short of the real thing consequently by skipping out on this 4-billion-year-long party you are depriving yourself of the primary source on what it mean to be alive and human now that i 've had a kid i can certify that it is terrifying and gruelling and in my book a small price to pay for the understanding let alone all the other benefit like having an outlet for your love a huge incentive for being a better person learning to balance love and responsibility and generally sorting your marble i want my health physical and mental to last a long a possible before i return to ash you are playing by a different book i really do n't know which one lead to contentment in my past experience the path to good thing would always go through voluntary inconvenience also your child is the best human being you 'll ever meet it would be a shame to have never met not trying to talk anyone into it there are a ton of prerequisite to satisfy but this is important stuff i learned edit and a for all the interests/hobbies i had to put on hold boy are they going to come back with a vengeance in a few short year they will be so much easier to justify,0

drinking and ready to go just cracked a bottle of wine and keep looking at my purse there s a month supply of ativan in there so incredibly tempted,1
trying to figure out how to live a life worth living when nobody seems to want to care or even acknowledge that i exist no matter what i do i ca n't seem to find anyone who will care about me in my early 20 i had this same exact problem but i wa in college so people could n't ignore me completely my professor had to give me assignment and my classmate had to work with me on group project sure my professor barely gave me any feedback or praise even though i got a on just about everything and my classmate did the bare minimum of interacting with me even though i always did most of the work on the project and compensated for group member that neglected to do their fair share but at least they had to acknowledge that i wa a living human being that could be talked to and would talk back in return back then i wa so annoyed by all that but thing were so much better than they are now i feel absolutely invisible i can not find anyone to care about the fact that i exist i can go on a depression forum and post about how i feel and some well-meaning stranger with no intention of actually getting to know me will show up and say those same canned phrase you matter you 're important people care about you do n't kill yourself and it 's very nice of them to freely give up their time to respond to stranger on the internet like that but unfortunately it doe n't help me feel any better they do n't know me they do n't want to know me they wo n't ever know me what i need is proof that one other human being will get to know me and care for me at least to the point where they would miss me if i were gone i have no one like that it 's probably been over five year since i had anyone like that i keep trying to figure out if there 's some way for me to have a fulfilling life even when no one will care about me maybe i could start caring for a bunch of animal and make their happiness my goal in life and maybe that would be enough or maybe if i make my life all about learning the pursuit of knowledge would be enough to make up for the fact that i do n't exist to anyone else i ended up getting a cat and watching a ton of documentary over the last few month i love my cat and she 's probably the main reason i 'm still alive but she 's le of a reason to stay and more of a reason why i ca n't go and now i know a bunch more about greek culture and world war ii and the development of the computer but it doe n't make up for the fact that i 'm completely alone i feel like a spaceman observing a planet from orbit learning about all these other people and society but never having a chance to interact with them so i have yet to figure out what i can do it 's gotten to the point where i fantasize about killing myself for attention i used to think that sort of thing wa just completely nonsensical but it make perfect sense to me now i 've been ignored and abandoned by so many people that killing myself might kill two bird with one stone i 'd be putting an end to a pointless go-nowhere life and also possibly getting someone to actually acknowledge that i exist ed a lot of people say the world doe n't owe anyone anything and maybe that 's true but if it 's really the case that this is just the way thing have to be for me then i do n't really want to hang around if the world doe n't owe me the opportunity to make a single friend then i do n't owe the world the ability to live guilt-free for abandoning me killing myself is really the only option left for getting at least a single person to take notice at this point even that might be wishful thinking growing up it never crossed my mind that this is what life would be like,1
doing something you want to do with no thought paid to the consequence or the response of parents/family obviously don t go rob a bank have some perspective but take that job you want or get that new piercing or car do something for yourself especially if it mean people won t like it it s freeing to realize you are in control of your own action,0

difference i never loved anyone like this girl and couldn t believe i could like someone so much and be under their spell our official relationship began over the summer near the end of july we rarely fought and had great sex and our family were very happy we were finally together we ve talked for many year about getting married and having kid however there were some red flag that i ignored early on because i wa in such love with her she constantly talked about her ex-boyfriend matt v and garry matt p and noah she went to school with and it kinda annoyed me if even looked at another girl snap or instagram story who wa just a friend from high school she would flip out and me she wa made me not use social medium around her such a instagram unless i posted photo with her and delete all girl even friend off my snapchat and phone contact she also made me also stop hanging out and talking with one of my best friend who wa a girl who wa basically my sister i agreed to all this because i loved her and wa under her spell while i would post her on my social medium such a facebook and instagram she did not put up a single post of me not to brag but she would post up picture with my father nice car and summer home but none with me ever i asked her why she did n't post me on social medium she 's like i 'm gon na wait to the school semi-formal to post you and no one ha to know my business she also is going through lot of difficulty with her family her father used to be a major lawyer but now is a struggling drug addict in and out of jail her mother is struggling to make end meat to send her and her sister to school and pay her mortgage i know this a bad situation but she would use it against me to get her way always with thing and turn a blind eye to her childish behavior when she left for school in late august i felt everything wa fine with our relationship we shared each other location so i know where she wa she is president of her sorority and would go to lot of fraternity party and mixer on weekend most night her location showed she made it back home other night she would sleep downtown were the party where i bought up my concern to her once she said she slept at her roommate cousin johnny 's house i joked saying did you sleep on the couch and she got mad at me saying she needed space for the rest of the day i didn t ask her again when she slept downtown because i didn t wan na anger her more another night she posted a snapchat story of her kissing a guy on the cheek this upset me i told her to take it down she told me she wanted space again and called me controlling one night i wa facetiming her late at night and one of her ex-boyfriend matt v hit her up to have sex and come over i tell her to tell him she is dating me and to tell him to get lost she 's like i do n't wan na be that girl who tell everyone i have a boyfriend and she told me not to worry she 's done with him later one that night i check her location because i had my suspicion and she wa not at her apartment i checked she wa at a upper class-man and grad student housing complex i then call her and she did n't answer and she freaked out on me she made up the excuse she wa visiting her little sister who wa having an anxiety attack and did n't wan na be at school but i also had her sister location on snap map and she wa at her freshman dorm mile away when i calculated the distance on google map my girlfriend told me her ex boyfriend matt v lived at another student housing complex on the other side of campus and i wa acting crazy and did n't trust her she got her sister to lie and tell me my girlfriend wa visiting her at the dorm when she wa really with matt v. she wanted space from me for the next day and didnt start talking to me again until i got her sister from the train on long island and took her home my girlfriend came home towards the end of september for her sister boyfriend father party and it wa clear going to back to school changed her alot she felt like she wa better and cooler than me in some way and wa acting suspicious at the party she went upstairs at one point and saw her taking selfies in the mirror i grab her phone and saw that on her snapchat she wa frequently sending snap to this guy george who i knew she had a thing with she made up the excuse that he wa gay and she did n't speak to me for the rest of the party we had sex later on that night and she assured to me we were exclusive and i had nothing to worry about around mid october i haven t seen her in over almost month and asked if i could visit her she said no she didn t want me invading her life up there also she gave some b.s excuse that i probably did n't want her to visit me when i wa in undergrad she began throw a huge temper tantrum like a little child saying that i wa replaceable and she would break up with me if i surprised her at albany i should ve broke up with her then but didn t because i loved her for so long and wa going to see her on thanksgiving and she said she wa going to let me come up to formal at the end of the semester end up going to formal in dec with another guy in the dress i bought her lol at the beginning of november her sister who go to the same school spoke to me about not liking school at albany and she didn t wan na go to date night later i asked if her sister wa going and she said no my gf her sister wa n't gon na be there i wa confused because my girlfriend in the week leading up to the formal/date night told me it wa gon na be cancelled later on that i got a snapchat from my gf in a dress and make up which she probably did n't mean to send me i asked her why she wa all dressed up and she said to me don t worry about it i asked her if she wa going to date night and she said it wa a first date themed party i then text her later on that night saying tell me the truth you are at date night with someone and she did n't respond her sister even told me she saw her there at the date night party them next day she text me saying he appreciate everything i do for her but wanted to take thing slow with me her excuse wa she need to focus on school work i asked if we were still exclusive but she said i shouldn t worry she gave some b.s excuse that she want to get back with me and there is no time frame when we get back together i lost my mind because i felt like i did and sacrificed so much for her the next step i took were excessive but led me to find she wa cheating on me i dmed her ex boyfriend garry from school on instagram on a whim i did this because i had my suspicion he told she didn t say ever she wa dating me and they had sex a few time together during the semester aslo during the summer she went over his house every thursday while she wa suppose to be at work i did n't know because i worked in the city in the summer during the week while she wa at his house he asked her about me and said i wa just her family friend that had i crush on her but she had no feeling at all for me he said when he dated her she cheated on him a bunch he wa able to prove it with a screenshot recording of her texting him to come over on our anniversary to come over at 3am and have sex he said he also saw her with other guy walking home some night he also said they she ha multiple guy in every frat there that she fuck aslo that her other ex boyfriend matt v lived at the housing complex i saw her on her location that night not the other one she told me and he saw her car parked there multiple time i also ca n't believe her little sister wa in on the lie too but i found out she wa also cheated on her boyfriend from back home too aslo when my girlfriend dated garry she cheated on him with the guy george she told me wa gay when i finally confronted her about it and showed her the text she sent garry with the date and time showing her number she went crazy and denied everything saying now there wa chance of u getting back together in the future and how dare i reach out to garry i also reached out to other people at her school and they all told me she said i wa n't her boyfriend when they asked just a family friend from home and they saw her hooking up with multiple people when her mom called me i told her everything about her daughter cheating on me she didn t believe it she wanted u to meet over the winter break and talk thing out and be friend for now because

faced with two job opportunity hey guy i need some advice about a dilemma i ve been faced with hopefully this is the right sub for a casual conversation about my future career i m a master student but i ve got a job a well this job is pretty amazing it s a great opportunity with a large company to work within the field of my study i recently sent out an email to another employer telling them who i wa and how i dreamt of changing the world it wa one of those email i never expected to get a reply to i m not qualified for what they do and all i really have to offer is my determination to change the world however i got a reply today saying they are interested and would love for me to do an internship with them now this is an incredible opportunity i could learn everything about the industry and it could potentially be the first step in me fulfilling my dream but always a but to do this i have to give up my current job my current job is something i do appreciate and think could have a great impact on the world but i just can not bring myself to be a excited about it a i am about the second internship so i guess what s holding me back is if i should play it safe and remain with my current job where i for sure will have a comfortable career or jump into the abyss and maybe fulfill my absolute dream my family is telling me to stay with my job basically saying it would be ungrateful not to any thoughtsideas,0

i never understood the whole anti college anti high school attitude of reddit so many people on here talk about how much of a waste of time it is to spend money on college and how useless high school is and that going straight to work or going straight to trade school or something is better i personally never understood this attitude i mean yeah college is expensive and going straight to work is financially wise af but there just so many experience to have and thing to learn about yourself and the world that going straight to work will never help you with going to college and learning about a wide array of topic from some of the smartest people in their field is truly something that ca n't be experienced anywhere else on top of that most people who graduate high school are have a hunch about what they want to study but it 's never really percent certainty for the average person there 's still so much more to learn about the people around you and how they interact with each other outside of the work environment and just in general what different kind of people are like i feel like an extra year outside of high school should be there just for people to travel and meet people and learn stuff outside of their career interest just to develop more a a person and be happy with life and have memory you fondly look back on,0

it 's 4pm i skipped school today and i do n't have the strength to get out of bed i 'm studying at an amazing private art school that cost euro a year i got accepted in second year right when i got out of highschool which usually never happens they told me they were impressed by my skill and by my artistic sensibility for someone my age i 'm the youngest guy in my class yet i ca n't bring myself to go to school it probably ha something to with the fact that i 'm failing at it i have social anxiety it 's not easy to go to school every day when i can so clearly see it in their eye what the fuck is that guy doing here he 's awkward and unfunny and ca n't draw shit he 's not even invested in his work they 're right i feel like i do n't belong here i 've been incredibly bad at everything i 've done since the year ha started every homework every test no exception i did n't go to an art school because i wa good at it no i did it because i 'm bad at literally everything else my creativity is the only likeable trait about me i 'm awkward selfish lazy clumsy but when i create something i like it 's like the universe is telling me hey maybe you 're not so worthless after all maybe you can make the difference in this dying overpopulated planet and it feel good it make me feel alive the thing is since i started studying here everything i 've made ha been incredibly shitty like a painful reminder that i 'm not so special a kick in the ball telling me that this is what happens when you actually believe people who tell you wow this is really good you have talent just because you 're slightly above average but that 's not enough i know it 's stupid it 's such a dumb reason to be depressed i ca n't help it my creativity and my art skill are the only thing i 've ever liked about myself and here i am realizing how shitty they are i know i should get my shit together and work on it improve it but i ca n't i just fucking can't my friend keep coming to me when they 're sad i 'm that one friend i 'm good at cheering people up i 'm good at listening telling them some crappy im14andthisisdeep advice and hugging them i 'll never stop doing it and i 'm never bothered by it but it hurt i ca n't share this negativity with them because they already have much more important thing to take care of and they 're already depressed so they definitely do n't need it so i keep it to myself that 's what i 've always done but it hurt and i 'm tired i 'm sorry i just reread this and it 's a mess i think i just needed to post it somewhere online even if no one read it it 's fine at least i let it all out it feel a little better already,1

i came to the realization everything in our world is made by a person just like you and me and there is no stopping you from creating something better i pretty much just got berated in an email exchange while inquiring about a job yesterday i approached a group of people i knew a girl in the group who i liked they were most certainly not friendly to my clumsy approach overheard them talking shit about me later on long ago that would have bothered me hugely i would have questioned all of my relationship with people and doubted my social skill or picked out some flaw in myself to ob over now i just do n't care i took a chance to do something some people laughed at me well shit i 'm still alive that wa fun felt a bit of adrenaline being talked about is better than not being talked about who say you ca n't be driven ambitious confident or smart you might have gap in your experience or knowledge of something but nobody wa born a damn genius a far a i 'm concerned having a negative perception of your ability what you can not do is only going to reinforce the belief you can not do that thing and stop you from practicing to improve innate talent is a bullshit abstraction created by mainstream society and medium to make you feel worthless and bad about yourself so what if you fail i suppose it 's more about the journey and the experience that your venture give you you a a person are worth more than material possession or arbitrary status frankly everybody is going to die tbh why not do something crazy scared of roller-coasters i 'll be damned if that stop me go to a theme park right now find the most thrilling unbelievably scary coaster and ride that bastard time in a row you do n't exist to impress somebody else not your parent not your closest friend not your partner you 're not a failure at life until you call yourself a failure yolo,0

i wa pleasantly surprised by fortnite 's save the world pve mode edit i am pleasantly surprised thought i would post this here a i think the /r/fortnite subreddit would just be an echo chamber i played a bit of the battle royale mode that everyone 's crazy about but i could never see the fun in dying time out of provided everyone is on the same skill level furthermore there is just something so disappointing about building a fort being killed a sniper that you could n't even see far away and having that fort vanish into the depth of instance hell on a whim i decided to try out save the world i wa n't expecting such a cartoony shooter to have such fleshed out skill tree crafting/building system and a wide array of diverse-looking character unlike pvp your fort actually matter for a longer amount of time and in some case your base stay a it wa when you built it in earlier quest a few hour in and i 'm still in over my head trying to figure out keybinds and faster way to build this mode really is a hidden gem if you 're into quick-paced base-building and horde-fighting once the whole game becomes free-to-play later this year i can imagine a lot of player having fun in the pve mode anyone else try save the world,0

i m 23f afraid that my boyfriend 23m gave up on life sorry for the long post tried to make it a short a possible but too much to explain first of all this is a throw away account because my boyfriend is also on reddit and i don t want him to see this me and my boyfriend are together for year now we met when we were year old in a club our relationship ha been through a lot of ups and down he cheated on me two time with two different girl yes i know i should have left him when it happened but he wasn t really himself at that time it will become clear later in the story so i forgave him and he never did it again it happened when we were together for month and when he wa going out a lot and stopped going out when it happened but that wa just a short presume also a short presume of his life his parent were both alcoholic they drank strong alcohol almost everyday and would fight together where my boyfriend could see it his mother had a liver disease and wa clearly sick his father wa kinda healthy so after a year of being together everything wa going fine he didn t go out that much any longer and focused on his class on june 17th we both had our final his father wa supposed to get home from work he wa a taxi driver but he didn t answer his phone and didn t came home so my boyfriend went to look for him on the road not much later he found his dad dead in the taxi with a lot of police surrounded he called me cry and i immediately went there it wa one of the painfullest thing to see ny boyfriend wa devastated really the funeral wa so beautifull and sad right when the father passed it clearly got worse with his mother she didn t care about life anymore she drank more and we were left alone with her she used to drink so much that she couldn t walk and would fall from the stair she woke up at 4pm and go to bed at 6am we couldn t go to bed before her because when we did we found her bleeding on the ground we had to call an ambulance a few time it wa so hard to see we couldn t work because if we left her alone she would maybe make a deadly fall or attempt suicide she used to cry and tell me and my boyfriend she want to die and is doing everything to be with her husband a soon a possible i think that wa the worst my boyfriend could ever hear in his life fast forward to year later his mom wa terminal she wa in so much pain she had trouble to eat she wa so thin and no doctor would help u we lived with all the struggle for about year with no help from nobody we were both still kid and had no clue how to handle it she died on september 10th the police didn t even tell u how she died they accused u first but shortly after they told u she died naturally but no cause of death we had to arrange her funeral all on our own when we were we had absolutely no idea what to do so we called a professional the funeral and everything costed about a 10k dollar my boyfriend wa devastated and wa in deep grief but i didn t see him cry so i think he is shock since then he refused to go in therapy and he ha no friend or family he can rely on only me the reason i think he gave up on life is because he just doesn t care about his health or about anything at all he refuse every help from a professional he started to do hard drug and soft drug luckily he stepped off from the hard drug because i threatened to leave him when he continued but he is still smoking a lot and didn t step off from the soft drug yet i tell him every day that i m scared for his health but everytime he tell me that he doesn t care and how sooner he dy the better this hurt so much because i really love him and want to grow old with him there are day that he tell me he want to kill himself and when we argue he just leaf with the car and text me that he is gon na end his life he never really tried it tho but i m afraid that he will one day he doesn t really look healthy neither he eats french fry almost everyday and barely any vegetable how can i help him and give him his will to live back i really need some advice because i m starting to lose my will to live too all because it s draining so much energy tl dr my 23f boyfriend 23m lost his both parent 55f 60m in three year he doesn t care about his health and say that how sooner he dy the better it is i m worried about him and want to save him from dark thought,1
i 'm new to the travel for business world and i have a few question thought this place might be a good start a little backstory i 'm i transitioned out of the shop and field so to speak roughly month ago i ran my own business throughout my 's but missing out on chunk of my daughter early year and the advent of another child on the way necessitated change i found a good business to work for where i could apply what i have learned over the first half of my working life so far somehow i found myself quickly climbing the rank and now i spend to day a week in the bay area of ca alone i actually enjoy it to a degree i 'm not anti-social but i 'm very task oriented so i tend to fixate on my daily objective i find myself back in the hotel room around or pm some day just checking out and watching a movie or picking up a book will suffice however other day i get this nagging feeling that i 'm wasting valuable time i could be doing something more entertaining/fulfilling/educational etc i 'm interested in hearing from people with similar situation and what they 've found to help kill the time or expand on themselves however i 'm still interested in hearing good book recommendation or good movie hell even good place to eat if anyone happens to have area specific recommendation after a little conversation thanks in advance everyone,0
free shipping is kinda mislabeling you 're always paying for the shipping if it 's free then in actuality it 's just added to the price of the product shipping ha to be paid and with your money the only exception is subscription service where you pay a monthly fee but the thing is if the average amazon customer for example spends more than a month cost of prime subscription in free shipping that cost once again ha to be paid with money from sale idk why i 'm writing this i just get a little irritated when people are excited about free shipping nothing is free you 're just paying for it in a more roundabout way in the end the shipping fee ha to be paid with the vendor money which they make off of you that mean higher expense for the vendor which mean they need to charge more to stay afloat,0

everyone else i don t want to drive twenty minute to see you when just getting out of bed is like climbing a mountain i know you mean well but it s not just the thought that count it s the effort too i don t want to know that people have it worse than me i don t want to hear about the time you got divorced and your mom died in the same week but here you are now scarless and happy if i could just stop and get over it don t you think i would have done that year ago my monster isn t like yours my monster stay when the reason have gone away it tell me that i m worthless simply because i m depressed you want me to feel your empathy but all i feel is isolation when i m depressed i m a scared little child cowering in a corner i don t know what to do and i don t see a way out the people moving around me fade into the background like algae seen through a murky lake when i reach out of the fog and try to catch the hand of a passerby i see in their eye their thought about me they are judging me they have the answer where i don t they were able to get through it but i am not they know what it s like because they ve been sad before they think what worked for them will work for me and since it s not their fault i feel this way it s my fault i m already judging myself so it s natural to project that into other people now i am doubly judged i judge myself and i see others judging me i don t belong here i am not normal i am not wanted i m not good enough so i stop reaching out and you don t get it you think that because i don t ever ask you to help me that i don t want your help you get frustrated because you just can t get through to me you don t understand why i can t just accept your love you want to know why it s because i don t believe i deserve to be loved and why should i i don t love myself ii i don t like anything about me i hate myself it feel like something about me about my core is broken i do not experience depression i am depression something about the way i wa put together is wrong the common thing in my life is me my depression and i. why couldn t i have just said yes to the girl left when i knew it wa over saved my money for bill i hate that i make so many mistake i hate myself and i can t see the way to get better no one want to help me or if they do they don t understand me they are uncomfortable around my depression i make a joke about death no one get it they haven t been there they see a menacing threat an evil shadow where i see a warm embrace soothing quiet and certain peace i ve exhausted all my option i ve tried everything i hate that i can t fix myself but don t believe for a second that i don t want to live i do those time that i stay at home alone in the dark still in bed skipping work school friend promise those are the day it take everything in me just to stay alive but i m prolonging the life of someone i hate and i resent that iii what is it that i want when i m like that locked up in my house refusing call letting netflix play until i want to vomit all over my formerly favorite show what doe someone who hate themselves who see themselves a broken and unfixable what doe that person need honestly a hug i want someone to come over and hug me and not let go i want to feel like i m not in your way that you d rather be nowhere else in the world than here with me comforting me i want to know that you would stay all day if that s how long it take i don t want you to talk about yourself i want you to be interested in me i want you to ask question about how it feel i want you to look in my eye with concern i want you to smile at me simply because you re pleased to see me i want to know that you ll spend a much time a it take to understand exactly how i feel i want you to talk quietly i want you to enjoy some silence with me i want to know that there is nothing i have to do in exchange for you doing this for me that i don t have to earn it i need to know that you are complete without me so there s nothing i have to do for you unless i feel like it and i want to know that you aren t doing anything for me for any other reason than you feel like it why do i want you to do this it s because i want you to show me that i am valuable because i can t believe the word anymore i want you to work hard to understand me because i can t feel connection anymore i need you to prove it to me with your action because the word lost their meaning to me i do want you to tell me over and over again how it totally make sense to you that i m depressed that you would be depressed too if you were me that i don t owe anyone my happiness i want you to tell me that the people who say otherwise are dead wrong and you know what maybe once you ve done this i might listen to your advice about eating right and exercising maybe i can articulate why your suggestion wouldn t work for me and we can figure out something else together but i can t open up to you until you show me you love me because remember i hate myself and it s easier to believe you hate me too than to accept that you love me so before you ask if i m seeing a counselor ask me what kind of help ha been effective for me before you try to solve my problem listen to me telling you what my problem really are before suggesting i get out and see people spend some time with me alone and maybe after you give me a long hug i might want to go to your party,1

it 's no surprise that life itself can be one big competition and i often hate it tldr it is a if life itself is even a type of hunger game or even we designed it to be that way it is no surprise that life is pretty competitive in many area such a in seeking for a job getting a stable life getting good grade and so on this is of course helpful in some area and failure are more learning experience than success i have encountered lot of competition in my life and there wa a time where i wa pretty competitive myself but i will admit that i have not desired to be that competitive again becuase there are more memory of self-destruction rather than of self-preservation and self-challenge but becuase of this i also realised that i became way more passive a a result and almost every single time i feel an ounce of competition against myself or against someone else i often repress it and that is incredibly damaging to me when it come to moment where competition or challenge or stress is a necessary push or a mean of arousal and i will admit that i mostly repress it becuase i know how competitive can be destructive or devastating for some i know that this level of empathy is taken in the wrong direction sometimes which i have not found a way to counter it or repress it to some extent because it is a if withholding my own will to succeed just to let others succeed because i know how devastating the feeling of failure is but those moment or even year of competition often took a more destructive direction for starter i often feel devastated and very self-destructive when a failure or a loss happens and even before in my more competitive year it wa that ugly i am well-aware that this is possible becuase of a more personal issue such a a core belief that involves self-contempt and self-hatred and becuase of that anything that get in my way i am already destroying myself from the inside even for example when there is a threat or a challenge in front of me i often find it hard to focus becuase i am too busy fighting against myself from the inside a if my own gear in my brain are not co-operating with each other becuase of this .i often felt that i wa under constant and constant competition a if everything is a competition and that is really ugly probably another reason why i became more passive becuase i grew tired of that feeling it became like a constant state of survival like life or death it wa ugly and it wa horrifying there wa also another aspect that i found it hard to be competitive is the compulsion a in you have to do it .whether you like or not on one hand i can understand how this build up discipline to do the more challenging thing and continue to persist through it but on the other hand it is incredibly agonising especially if you do not know why you are doing it or the reason why you are doing it is not motivating or a good reason to do it such a i had an eating disorder for three year and i still remember the agonising feeling for having to do the exercise and the diet whether i wanted to or not despite that there wa a core motivation or goal inside that wa way more destructive than it wa something that wa worth doing it wa an agonising and torturing feeling it is almost a if you already lost from the inside becuase you have no reason to be competitive and your own self-schema is turning against you basically to put it simply it is like the film 'whiplash where the protagonist is forced to push myself in his dream to be a good drummer but in a very destructive way his own self-belief is more destructive than disciplined or positive his desire to push wa more compulsive and torturing rather than the desire to push in a more healthy or stable manner and his desire to push wa more to not let his inner voice to him that he is not a weakling or a failure or any other abusive thing the voice told him to similar to what his teacher said that is the kind of competition that i expressed mostly in my life and i grew tired of it and i want to change it i can not keep going like that anymore but i also know that this feeling can not be going on anymore becuase i know that not everyone think the same way and maybe even use it a an advantage to gain the upper hand regardless of the altruism or morality i do admit that i often sometimes avoid the competition becuase i know how the competition can be a destructive or humiliating experience to some call it a form of altruism but i am aware that this is also a weakness it is quite a shame that human have the capacity to be altruistic yet many people condone the idea that every man is for himself and some people even condone or like the idea of taking competition to a whole new level even humiliating or degrading their competition you can say all you want how awful that is they still get the upper hand and some people even like it good drama good tribalism and so on it kinda suck that all you want to do is to live life peacefully with little conflict but you have to go through a ton of unnecessary obstacle and competition to achieve what you desire it is a if life itself is even a type of hunger game or even we designed it to be that way,0

my opinion on the pinocchio paradox hallo there wa this idea i thought of a long time ago that i wanted people 's opinion on it wa nothing too big i just wanted a nice little discussion however i put that on rest since i did n't know where exactly i should talk about that recently i came into notice of r/casualconversation which i found to be a neat little place to talk about random stuff i thought it would be great to be finally able to share and discus about this idea so without further ado here it is if pinocchio say my nose will now grow he would be lying and this will cause the nose of his to grow however since his nose grew he would not be lying and his nose should not grow i believe that the answer to this solution is his nose will grow if pinnochio say the special statement this is because the nose only grows if pinnochio himself is the one who is lying and note that the statement is said before the nose started to grow his nose only corresponds if he is lying or not it doe not count the action of itself either if we count in these two factor i believe we will have a solid reasoning that the answer to this paradox will be that his nose will grow so er well what do you think,0

first i killed the athlete there wa n't much of him to begin with so it wa easy at the least he tried to give an effort to materialize during my college day he even joined some after school group of friend to play with that did n't really go anywhere next i killed the gamer he wa easy to kill too because of the need the corporate life taking much of my time did n't leave enough breathing room for him to keep up a fight his antic still surface every now and then making me wish for adventure and the blood pumping suspense or action of his previous endeavor i just stuffed his mouth with career dream he did n't really struggle a he believed that to asphyxiate wa actually reasonable next i killed the party boy this one took a little bit more orchestration than the previous two i had to kill his connection with his friend i had to starve him of his former social saturation and in a way that he wo n't easily recourse back i made his friend believe he did n't need the contact that he wa happy the party boy slowly lost his spirit that 's when i went for the jugular to end his pain next i killed the musician i almost did n't like killing him he 's the most recent one and the most difficult one to get rid of he ha support your see all the feeling and emotion closing through him everytime he hears play or sings a song give him enough strength to push back he 's even made a solid group of friend that push and pull him to their grace but an opening came in the guise of leaving the country that tiny waver in his resolve let me sneak in a stab it wa easy enough from then on i 'm just afraid that eventually i might kill the writer too and when i do i do n't really know what 's left i 'm actually surprised to realize that i 've been hurting myself without physically doing so i 've lost more of myself in the past few month than i ever had in year and i 'm not making any more of me than what i already have p i wrote this to myself at a bad time about a year ago and putting what i 've been doing in word ha surprisingly help me curb and slowly regain myself throughout the past year i still get span of time where i feel like nothing where i feel afraid of being nothing that i 'd rather just lose my life but remember all you 've been through thing may not feel the best now but you are not worthless you matter there 's a value to everything you 've done and accomplished so let 's all hold on and hold tight edit thank you so much for giving my first gold kind stranger and to everybody who 's commenting i wish i had more time to reply to all of you i 'm surprised with the turnout and even more with how people feel the same and are/is going through losing part of themselves let 's all keep holding on to those and try our best not to lose more than we do and for those who feel empty it 's never too late to find yourself let 's all fight for it even if it start with just getting up from your bed in the morning,1

i personally experience significant depression throughout late fall and winter it really did n't begin until my mid 20 but the other day i started thinking from an evolutionary perspective many animal spend most of the year preparing for the survival of winter some store food some hibernate some migrate in term of human history having to actually survive winter ha n't been too long ago think of the donner party or the first colonist that landed in jamestown in a sense it feel like every winter my mental well-being certainly go into a survival mode i know that sad is typically explained by decreased melanin eventually cascading down to decreased serotonin level but i 've never seen an article suggesting the root cause being more vestigial in nature like a repressed hibernation from when we used to have to,1

i ve felt this way for a long time now but it feel like i m being torn apart a of late nobody know sorry for any bad format or error and please redirect if there s a more proper sub reddit for this post i m a year old guy and i don t think i have time or money to work and see a therapist so a bit of backstory for me is i grew up in a family by myself for the most part my mom and dad were my grandparent so my brother and sister we re all out of the house by the time i wa i wa your typical edgy and nerdy kid in school and frankly looking back at it i wa a real asshole to my parent in the later year the trouble started in my senior year highschool yo i finally wa blossoming and starting to look good and feel confident with other people i had just got out of a bad relationship i wa clingy and manipulative to her in my sophomore year i had found out my dad had been diagnosed with cancer and that he had year left at the time i didn t really think about it i wanted to ignore it so i did i began dating to try and keep me occupied a well and it worked a little one of the thing i will never see myself living down is the christmas of senior year the summer before my dad had broken my ipad which i wa always glued to a a mean to punish me for not taking care of thing while he and my mom were out of state for chemotherapy that christmas i had saved up just enough to get me a new ipad and i bought one and had it shipped to me a a surprise gift i had literally only enough money to buy my parent a stupid scarf that they could split between each other so christmas day come along and i bring the scarf down to them and show them explaining how i just didn t have money this year so they d have to split it they were so happy about it they said that they loved it a for me they didn t have a lot of money that year again chemo and time off work they got me some clothes and my dad bought me a cd of my favorite band that i could play in my car then i ran back upstairs and brought the ipad down next what i said next make me feel sick look like santa brought me something too and i showed them the ipad they got really mad about it and threw a fit i can t remember the detail very well but i remember my dad being mad saying that i wa faking my happiness for the cd and my mom saying no wonder i didn t have money to pay for proper gift and that it s ridiculous for them to have a measly scarf i fucked up really bad fast forward to the summer of at this point i had been dating another girl for the last month and she knew everything about my family s situation and wa very kind and patient in july my dad passed away due to pancreatic cancer i lied to my mom about going to work for the next two week and spent all my time at my girlfriend while on leave from my job i remember so vividly about the week leading up to his death and i had nightmare for a good month or two at one point i wa so afraid to sleep because i would always see my dad again i felt so guilty because of the brat i wa i remember wishing that he would die faster over stupid shit when he d yell at me i remember telling my best friend i wouldn t care when he died because of how mad he made me sometimes sure he wa mean and always finding mean thing to say but it wasn t his fault i remember reading some note he had wrote saying how he need to be nicer to me because the steroid he wa under often made him angry i know i wa wrong for feeling that way even when i did but it still feel like a stab in my heart i feel like a monster for ever behaving like that a couple month after he passed i made another huge mistake again another one that looking back on i never should have done i moved in with my girlfriend at the time i wa she wa she wa still in highschool due to some transfer issue i stayed with her family for about month or so in october of i wa kicked out of the house by my mom because i wa ignoring her and disobeying her rule my gfs parent were very kind and said i could stay a long a i needed to get back on my foot i told them a month at most and that i d pay rent they said no rent month and not a penny tho i definitely caused bill to go up i never told my mom i wa with her family i knew it wa wrong my gf ha a brother who wa at the time who life with them to this day he wa attacked by dog a a child and had a stroke so he wa a little slower than others while i stayed there i would constantly tease him and small way to irritate him the way he unknowingly irritated me my gfs mother found out eventually and held a meeting about it saying that we need to stop fighting i only teased him because he get babied hard and life with them with no job or communication outside of video game and i still believe him to be taking advantage of the family a he s not on a level of disability that effect common day activity and could easily support himself ironic of me to think that about him i know anyways the summer came and passed and it wa time for me and her to leave she wanted to go to an expensive university outside of our city by a few hour so i moved with her to the university we both applied and were accepted she had her parent support and grant i didn t i had to cancel my admission due to my lack of fund and find my own place to stay first year were required to live on campus i wa charged the fee for reserving a dorm so i wa set back by a few hundred dollar too so i had to look for a job i want to be a teacher so i felt like i needed to get my foot wet i applied to the school system in town and became a substitute teacher for a year well that did not pay well at all a month and only one paycheck when i wa broke i wa broke then come mistake i had her start helping me year wa now early at this point we had been together over year she worked part time just to get spending money for herself however because i wa refusing to get a second job i wa barely able to pay bill she started paying for our date please don t talk to me about this part i know it is my duty to pay for date or at least my half but i wa incredibly desperate for money and for u to have fun i fucking hate myself for doing this to her and at the time i wa ignoring the way i wa using her at one point we sold her viola to get only for rent that i managed to still make she insisted to because she didn t play it and that i am quite good at my violin and that mine wa extremely expensive anyways she seemed to be fine with it so we sold hers she didn t tell me til later and i didn t realize at the time that she wa very upset to get rid of her instrument her birthday is on march 31st so eventually the time came around and because i wa still working s poor job and not looking else where i only had money to pay for our meal a her gift this wa something i usually did on every date leading up to u moving out during the summer we drove down to texas to visit my mom who had been living in a beach home with her dog we stayed for two week and her family even came down to visit too i left about the time they arrived because i had overstayed my welcome and my gf wa now staying with her family so the6 could have vacation together so i drove home by myself and got a new job that paid quite well unfortunately i wa so busy focused on work that i hardly kept in contact and when i did it wa through million of thoughtless and short text eventually she called me and broke some news to me because of how distant i had been she wanted to end thing when she moved back to town from her parent during the summer she told me how she felt about everything and how i treated her she told me that the week of her birthday wa the worst week of her life because i had left her by herself during some major exam and that i wasn t there to support her emotionally she told me one of her guy friend wa always there though turn out he had feeling for her and had confessed while we were dating and that she shot him down for me she told me that she started to grow feeling for him too and that she still loved me she told me that she felt so guilty about liking him i imagine she felt how i do now honestly i took two sick day when i could afford rent to go visit her only once that entire summer after our vacation we talked everything out and she said we could try again her mom wa even happy that i surprised her by visiting well when she finally came back to the university a few week later we began to work it out i wa now paying my way and sometimes for both of u on date again and outside of work i wa always giving her attention and taking her place then in october she told me that she still felt wrong she saw that i wa trying however her mom had began to start bothering her about me every time they came and visited they would tell her not to invite me to see them which they used to always invite me themselves they also began asking if she met any cute college guy i still felt like i couldn t be in college while working still am saving up actually it became very apparent that her mom no longer liked me i honestly don t know when or what made her start acting this way especially since i wa now beginning to be more responsible my gf then told me she still had feeling for the guy from before and that because her mom wa guilting her she could have a relationship without stressing out really badly needle to say i wa heartbroken we had a week break from each other and we stayed together til early november when she finally dumped me she said she wanted to stay single and that she wanted to be friend still i told her no because being friend hurt me too much we both still feeling for each other and still do i know it s super bad and that it s not healthy but for the past few month we ve been hooking up and nobody know about u just simple night together and occasionally we eat out we only go out if i absolutely insist on it and i make sure to pay for every date i work at an extremely good job now and do a standard hour and am starting to save up my money each time she leaf there s eventually a text between u where she say it hurt to be together and do stuff like that because it make her miss me and that she can t date me anymore because of time and her mom would flip if we dated again a of recently we ve stopped hooking up but maybe once every two weekend and i m trying to find someone else to be with because i m ultimately afraid of being alone don t get me wrong i m not hooking up with her to have company i still really love her but i want to distract myself so that i can let her go she tell me she ha no time or interest in dating anyone right now and she s completely uninterested in the guy from before now i know a lot of this info seems unrelated but it all stem back to me i feel so isolated i ve never been one to make friend outside of work/school i am very introverted one thing i ve realized is that i always seem to be part of the crowd people don t walk up to me to be friendly i walk up to them honestly it s been that way since highschool i m very funny and people say i m very interesting yet i ve been trying for a bit now and nothing s changed i m trying to be bold and make friend there s even a few girl that i ve talked to however i feel like nobody is interested in me i m the end of every conversation i ve honestly only ever been truly happy when i m with my old gf perhaps i wa also using her for attention for someone to love me that s what it feel like but i also really truly think i love her after the first few month i knew she wa the one now without her it leaf the reality she used to hide from me without her there is nobody who care my family doe but i feel so disgusted with how i ve treated them and my mom constantly bicker with me still and besides what could i rely on my family for other than short spurt of support i don t know how to word that better i need friend i need people who like me outside of work but i don t go to uni and i can t go to bar and frankly i ve never been interested in party where you get drunk and high what the hell is wrong with me and why can t i find anyone that like me for who i am what can i do to feel better in straight truth i ve honestly thought to kill my self and due to stress and of course poor fincancing ive starved myself to lose pound don t worry i m glad to have lost them i really wish i had the gut to end it all but i don t death is the most scary thing i can imagine so nobody ha to worry there but i need to know what to do i need advice i don t care if you guy judge me for my action i know i fucked up and i m probably paying the price now but what can i do to help myself,1
really disappointed when i do n't take the opportunity to kill myself i get the perfect window of time to do it but for some reason end up distracting or questioning myself until i 'm out of time then when it sink in that i 've missed another perfect opportunity i 'm hopelessly disappointed that i did n't take it,1
staying alive is torture want to die but ca n't kill myself i 'm miserable every single day i want to die but i 'm too much of a coward to kill myself i have no one to talk to and the people here are all fake who just say dumb shit like oh your family will miss you like that help in any way,1

it 's a hell of a lot easier to laugh than it is to cry i wa sitting in my grandfather 's dining room a few week ago and above his table he ha a big painting it 's a really beautiful painting and my grandfather usually ha pretty great story so i asked him about it he said that it wa kind of a funny story when he wa in college his grandmother lived nearby so he would sometime go visit her one of her favorite thing to do wa to go to an auction house nearby one weekend he and his grandmother went to the auction house together to watch the auction they had a general rule just to watch and not to buy anything they were walking around just looking around at the thing for sale when my grandfather saw this painting he asked the auctioneer how much a painting like that might go for the auctioneer said that it really depended on who wa buying that day so my grandfather and his mother moved on to look at the other item a little later a the auction wa going on the painting came up for sale people were bidding on the painting like crazy so my grandfather jokingly raised his paddle sure enough he won the auction the painting wa his for except he did n't have so his grandmother who wa quite wealthy decided to buy it for him he also did n't have the space for this painting so he sent it home to his mom 's house when my grandfather got home for summer break his sibling got wind of the painting his grandmother got for him they were not pleased so his grandmother decided to write all his sibling a check for and his mom decided that she would like to keep the painting in the end my grandfather a broke college student ended up with a painting that stayed in his mom 's house until she died and his sibling ended up with a check it 's kinda a funny story now but i can imagine it wa not so funny at the moment my grandfather finished the story by saying it is what it is and it 's a whole hell of a lot easier to laugh than it is to cry this is some of the best advice i 've ever received and it made me wonder what kind of story did your grandparent tell you what 's the best piece of advice you 've ever received do you have any fun story you 'd like to share,0

doe anyone else get knocked down so easily by seemingly small thing or instance because it just add to the bigger issue that lingers in the mind i have an issue with self-esteem self-doubt and just having a default mood that 's negative small issue come up that any regular resilient person would be able to brush off but i ca n't because it just put that thought in my head that go see this is confirmation that you 're a worthless piece of shit and so it offset my mood so deeply that anyone observing me would wonder why it bother me so much because all they see is a small issue that can be easily get over not the deeper problem at hand fuck man fuck,1
do n't really have anyone in my life to share the good news with so here go i got a job for the first time in year i am employed i wa finishing my degree until just a few month ago and for most of my time in school i wa n't able to find a job since i lived in an area that wa oversaturated with unqualified student looking for hourly work at restaurant and such then these past six month i 've been legitimately too sick to even consider working until literally just a few day ago i 've been going through very expensive and invasive test these last few month and we 're finally starting to figure out what 's wrong with me and i 'm finally on medication that help for le than a week now i 've been pain free and able to live my life like a normal healthy person which is already so incredible for me since i 'd forgotten what it felt like to feel capable and self reliant just a few day ago i decided to go ahead and apply for a job at a nice restaurant up the street but i wa n't getting my hope up since i 've gotten so used to being rejected from all the job i 've applied to these past few year but just yesterday i wa interviewed and officially offered the job and i start next week i have n't been this happy in such a long time that i do n't even remember i 'd completely lost faith in myself and now i actually feel optimistic for my future maybe for the first time ever which is kind of scary and unfamiliar i even baked a huge cake today i 'm just so happy to be employed that i start cry when i think about it edit wow i wa gone for easter and just logged back in and i am so amazed and grateful at how much positive support i 'm getting thank you all so much i 've been going through a tough time lately not having any friend and being sick all the time and i feel a lot le alone now a silly a that might sound you guy are the best,0

a friend of mine said this the other day and i immediately lost all respect for her well i shouldn t say friend acquaintance really i have told almost nobody about my depression in general i always thought it wa pretty explicitly obvious just from my mannerism but people tend to think i m just sort of slow and weird if they didn t know me before it really hit when i wa outgoing and energetic and spoke at lightning speed anyway i have never told anyone irl this but i have attempted suicide by od time i always woke up and never in a hospital or surrounded by anyone so nobody but me ever found out i have specifically kept this a secret because i do not want attention i don t want anyone to look at me particularly in a state like that truth is dying is hard and i m afraid of it you can genuinely want to die and still retain the instinct to cower away from it i do i don t have the courage to shoot myself oding seems like one of the most painless way to go which is why people do it doesn t mean i m not profoundly aching to not exist anymore anyway we were at a party with a few people when she said this and everyone pretty much just nodded and agreed i wa furious and disgusted even if they were just doing it for attention shouldn t you have sympathy for someone so desperate that they would risk their own lives/liver damage just for their problem to be noticed people are so unempathetic it s downright staggering at time,1

currently sitting in a hotel near beachy head one of the world 's most famous suicide spot i 'm hoping to jump tomorrow i spent the day walking around the cliff i 've never been here before but settled on this place because it ha such a high success rate i promised myself that if i were to go through with this i had to make sure i succeeded the first time and did n't just end up with some brain or internal organ injury my only regret is that some poor team will have to clean up my remains but i 'd rather a team of experienced people do that than being discovered by someone i know i 've wanted to commit suicide for a while now but even still before i arrived here i wa worried that i 'd see it and be too scared to do it outside of my own home but it is very peaceful here it 's almost a surreal place it 's perfect i wa also worried about encountering the volunteer who try to stop people from jumping but i did n't see any on my walk today though that may have been due to the weather i 've posted on here before under a couple of usernames and have had some nice message of support so i thought it wa fitting to write a little goodbye to the few people who cared towards the end you guy do great work for many people if any of you happen to live in eastbourne and hear about a young man jumping in the next few day just know that i 'm finally at peace i 'm sound of mind and it 's what i wanted,1

love of my life left me why i honestly do n't want to think about suicide i know it doe n't fix anything and will only bring harm to my family i write here not because i want to suicide but because i believe there are some good people out there who will just listen to what i say and help me think about my future maybe my problem is nothing compared to the awful experience other people had but that is just what make me want to die i 'm sorry if i sound like a kid or somehow hurt others just by saying that i 'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask for help i have a girlfriend i mean not just a girlfriend to me we 've been together for almost year now we met in college spent almost every minute together i mean it we lived in dorm together took same class we both were n't very social so literally almost every single minute passed together we were really happy our parent met we were serious then we graduated and started working we only saw each other once a week for few hour we both live with our parent and very far from each other today out of nowhere she told me she want to have a break that she is so unhappy but she is not sure whether this unhappiness is because of me or not she said to me she cry in morning because she is unhappy and she did n't tell me we never lied to each other or hid something except this i 'm shocked i mean this mind sound stupid but i felt like we were one she is my greatest friend my only true friend she wa like me i could talk literally anything with her without hesitation she wa the same i know now she want a break she say she need to think whether she is unhappy because of me or not i do n't even get it i ask you whoever care is there any possibility someone who is that close to me like my mother to just say i need a break let 's not meet for a time which i can not give you a precise one i ca n't stop thinking but i just do n't see the possibility no matter what happened in my life whether the cause is her or not i would have never left her because i know she is worth going through hell i would never guess something like this would happen because i thought she wa like me we were one and even if life wa shit we would get over it together i 'm not the greatest guy i know that but i feel like i do n't deserve this either i 'm day ago wa my birthday but i am pretty sure there will never be someone like her in my life if i ever lose her i have lived my whole life with only one purpose which is to live with the people you love together to the end of your time i cared only about love why would she even leave me i seriously do not get it someone please give me an idea why she might have done that,1
hi guy i 'm going to bed but basically i have a very stressful thing to do tomorrow and i 'd love to see some interesting message awaiting me in the morning this might be a dumb idea and it may not even work out but here 's your topic-what do you think about ai is it possible for them to take over or is their limit in the coding they 're given ca n't wait to see your opinion i 'll try to reply to message in the morning but otherwise gnight,0
i feel like the only reason to get out of bed and continue working is to prove to the world that i have enough strength and self-respect to do what it take to pay my bill but without anyone else to share my life with what 's the point i just have a job to pay my mortgage and hangout with my neighbor and feed my cat,1

i 've recently come to term with my depression ive contemplated suicide but i do n't think i will ever do it but every day when i 'm driving to school i have this wish that someone would just blind side and kill me i think that 's just an excuse for my selfish desire to die i think it would be better for my family the memory of having a smart and happy child would be preserved i would go without anyone knowing about my mental health issue they would just say it wa an unfortunate accident doe anyone else think like this,1

i give up this is what i wrote a month ago to a friend have you ever been crushed i mean that in every sense of the word having every last dream be taken away from you some because of your sheer fucking incompentence and some because this is how life is absolutely fucking nothing you do going well your entire life being a trail of failuire with not even the slightest shadow of success feeling like a worthless piece of shit living for no reason writing shit in a journal or notepad or whatever the fuck just to not bother others with your senseless bullshit that noone care about or can understand not truthly caring about a single person because every time you do they get taken away waking up for no reason only to repeat the same shit you did day ago the monotony of it all eating away at you and yet you somehow find a beacon of hope a new dream and then you fuck that up too so badly you do n't even know if you should get out of bed because what 's the fucking point anyway staring blankly at something every minute because now only your own toughts can entertain you but everything you think about is depressing wasting all your talent because of course you do why would n't that happend knowing that next morning when you wake up all you 're going to think about is how fucking long is this thing gon na take to kill me and how much will i suffer before then and is it worth it cutting thing short depression is at the 9th ring of hell and it 's going down with humanity now i have to ask myself is it even worth pressing enter now i just said fuck it and i 'm going to go with my plan once i get to year old i 'll write a testament that give all my asset a 45k euro apartment to a girl i love that completely ignores me why her i do n't know nor do i care anymore it 's the same thing giving it to anyone else anyway after that come the sharpest knife i can find subclavial artery unconsciousness in second death in le than you can leave comment and opinion but leave the light at the end of the tunnel bullshit out it really doesn t do anything other than to clog up the comment,1

withdrawing from my medication hello… i m not really at risk but i do feel quite awful to the extent that it s overriding my fear of posting so… basically i ve been severely depressed for year with no drug or treatment making any real difference until recently having to work and function independently pushed me so close to cracking completely that i came urgently under the care of a psychiatrist i live in the uk so that is uh… serious i mean that the waiting list are huge and it s uncommon for them to be too involved in a mundane condition like depression so through a combination of them being extremely reasonable and kind and my being a pharmacist i wa able to get on nardil which changed my life it wa like a genuine happy pill and felt like it gave me therapy too—it s indescribable how effective it wa and how thoroughly my thought process changed anyway it s a few month later and i have to come off it due to bad liver result i m down from 75mg to 30mg and it feel like a negative dose i m cry before i m conscious all i can do is be cocooned in bed and i get into a terribly upsetting state when i m skyping with my girlfriend where i want to talk and be happy but i can barely say a word the most minor and irrational thing cause rumination and a plummeting mood and i m already stuffing myself with ebay lithium to take the edge off hahaha it doe stop the tear it feel like flower for algernon in that i m watching my capacity to be a happy or content person flow down the drain in front of me i have hope in that after a fortnight of no drug i m being started on parnate instead but in the meantime this is ridiculous i m not sure i ll be able to respond to any comment but i am very grateful and again am really more just very sad than actively at any form of risk thanks for your time,1

just wanted to put my thought out there in case anyone relates i 've dealt with depression since the beginning of high school and did shitty in school had no friend did n't take care of myself my parent always denied i had depression because it ran in our family and they were in denial they finally let me go under med although i am on a third antidepressant now and it 's not helping me therefore they think i 'm making up the fact that i 'm depressed but i literally have no motivation in life and it 's not just a normal laziness issue i just see no point in life and am not grateful for everything i have which is a lot and i know it i feel guilty for not being grateful but i am just never satisfied and always miserable is there a way to get out of this i try working out but i can never commit to it anyone else just have a super negative outlook on the world,1

everything is always my fault at least thats how everyone seems to think i hate anxiety so much and at the same time i hate i got treatment that helped me enough to not kill myself when i planned to maybe i will never consider anyone my friend or that they like me i will always wait for them to ask me or follow their every word literally and then be at fault when i get anxious apparently telling them i have trouble feeling like i can go with them isnt enough to understand i will feel left out if they just go without saying anything to me i hate everything so much but even so i cant even draw a little blood sorry for the rant i just feel that i surely have just ruined the only friend i had and now i dont want to see them face to face again because of how scared i am it hurt so much thinking my death would probably feel like a relief,1

ceramic well actually i m an artist so it s more of a skill i want in my practice than a hobby but yeah it s dang expensive though with ceramic and a lot of hobby like it usually there are studio or park and rec class that you can take to learn and grow until you can afford your own equipment also a lot of equipment in great condition pop up on craigslist and site like it if you look often enough and are willing to drive a little and i m sure that s the same in a lot of hobby it s mostly people who buy expensive equipment use it once and then realize that they can t dedicate time or energy to it and then sell at a fraction of the price,0

disclaimer throwaway acct for obvious reason and i apologise in advance if this is the wrong forum for this type of post today is my birthday and the majority of today i 've occupied my mind with thought of the recent verdict of michelle carter 's appeal denial and the beginning of her time to be served a well a revising my own note and i ca n't help but feel jealous of conrad roy i 've rewritten rough draft of the note i intend to leave behind for the unfortunate soul that find my body in a desolate parking lot with an rv hose duct taped to my exhaust pipe leading to the back passenger window i wish i had someone like ms. carter to care enough about me to support me and give me the push i need to finish what i 've started and what will inevitably happen anyway because right now i 've got no one in my life that even care enough to either indulge me in my suicidal wish or extend a helping hand much le send me a happy birthday text it 's not my intention to throw myself a pity party with this post i merely would like to share a different perspective on the agency an individual should have over how they decide to deal with their depression i wish i had anyone even half invested in me a michelle wa invested in conrad 's wish and while i understand some of the outrage and vitriol aimed at her i also believe that in a free society we are entitled to the right to say enough is enough and end thing on our own term we deserve that agency to make our own decision a long a it doe not bring physical harm upon others i understand there are alternative option for people who suffer through what the majority of sub here deal with do n't get it twisted suicide is not something that should be decided on a whim it is something that should not be taken lightly should be considered with deep introspection and only decided upon in the clearest state of mind you can muster for month i 've calculated and contemplated each and every option considered all possible avenue accessible to me i am at peace with my decision on what i want to do but i struggle with the strength to follow through with it and a fucked up a it may sound i wish i had my own michelle carter who understood my perspective and could help guide me to where i want to go ultimately no one else should be held accountable for the choice i make a an individual whether another person persuades me to do one thing or another,1

i 've become bored with my own pain i 've been severely depressed since i wa about i remember being a really happy younger child with lot of friend and then i started being the target of a lot of bullying from peer a well a from one particular family member who had a lot of control over my immediate family she owned our house and frequently invoked her ownership when i or my parent were not acting right at the same time my dad kind of lost interest in being involved in my life at all i 'm guessing that combination of thing is what started the depression but it morphed into something else entirely after a while i no longer really know how to interact with people and i feel sort of like a nonperson like i have no real personality or self i feel like i 've tried on different thing but none of them fit i used to talk to my few loved one about how i feel but i 've found that people get very tired of hearing it and that it in fact really hurt other people to hear it so i try not to overshare i 'm tired of hearing it too i 'm like everyone else who ha had over two decade of this feeling under his or her belt i 'm tired of it all i 'm tired of struggling of rallying and getting knocked back down i 'm in therapy and i 've tried many many medication i have small stretch of improvement but the depression is still unrelenting and a i 'm beginning to no longer be a young person i 'm thinking more and more that maybe it make sense to commit suicide maybe this is n't going to improve if it ha n't in over year i ca n't imagine being able to tolerate it much longer,1

i have been diagnosed with severe depression and every day is a fight with my thought i m constantly dealing with my brain telling me that life is terrible and that death would be nicer and i have no motivation to do anything my symptom show through me not going to class not answering texts/calls not cooking sleeping all day and never cleaning however i still make myself do some thing i enjoy like meeting up with friend for food doing my makeup to feel good about myself before i leave the house etc i find when i am acting like i m not depressed and in conversation with people i temporarily feel distracted and happier i come across a very cheerful because i am a talkative person and i put effort into my appearance so i don t look tired no one would guess that i m depressed except if they watched my daily habit or if i told them my deeper thought and feeling which doesn t easily come up in conversation i am good at talking about my feeling but when i say in my cheerful conversational voice yeah i m severely depressed it feel a if i m faking no one know about the constant struggle i m facing in my head except my therapist my mom is very supportive and trying to be helpful but she doesn t understand that i may not appear sad but still am deeply depressed she say thing like but you re doing okay right like you don t seem sad right now. but it s difficult to explain that while i come across cheerful i have no motivation to do thing i enjoy and i dread many aspect of life it is more than just sadness i also feel guilty when i go talk to my professor to ask for extension etc because i ve missed class and been unable to do work due to depression i feel a if they think i m making it up because of the way i look and how i appear energetic in conversation realistically i just do hair/makeup before i leave the house because it mask my depressed self and give me enough motivation to feel like i have my shit together and get thing done but i feel like i shouldn t because then i don t appear depressed doe anyone struggle with similar issue honestly this wa kind of just a rant make me feel better when i know others feel similarly,1

ok done they said the same old platitude that everyone ha heard a million time it get better take it day by day lot of people care about you etc so now that they know an embarrassing and vulnerable fact about me what have i gained do i feel better are they going to have any insight or advice that i have n't already learned ha no at best they have sympathy for me which i do n't want and at worst they will be uncomfortable and not want to interact with me anymore this happened with different friend before i finally learned my lesson i mean perhaps that help for people with very mild or temporary depression and that 's fine and all but it 's pretty discouraging when the advice literally begin and end with talk to someone if you say yeah so i tried that they 'll just throw their hand up and tell you to use drug or just say hang in there hang in there huh just a few more decade and you 'll die naturally hang in there every day is a living hell with no respite from the emotional numbness/pain but do it anyway depression cause you to be a worthless failure because you do n't have the motivation to further your career or social life but hang in there a a complete loser then of course the natural progression beyond 'someone is a 'therapist talk to a therapist and get help ok let me just pull money out of my as and pay hundred of dollar for someone who probably wo n't be able to do shit for me anyway but that 's another story,1

i feel so stuck i ca n't really believe im writing this right now but here i am and i feel like im moreso just trying to lay it all out in word for myself because my mind is so messed up and confused and i really dont know how to feel and/or what to do im and my a level are going to shit i havent even done my coursework thats overdue for month my teacher have given me so much extra time it crazy now it due in a week and i still havent even fucking done the shit but at the same time i cant be arsed i cant deal with it it just too much but at the same time i have nowhere else to go sometimes i have to ground myself because i feel so out of it sometimes like i need to stroke a rough piece of metal or wood because it brings me back to earth and make it all feel real again sometimes i take a look at my surroundings too closely and the 3d image of life overwhelms me it so surreal that i need to close my eye and just listen to my own breathing to calm me down i just want you to know that im not mental this is only occasionally i dont constantly feel like this but moment like this do put me into existential issue and really make me feel strange moment like this cause numbness and the numbness lead to shit like right now i have a strong desire for someone to beat me up so bad there blood or for me to harm myself i dont mean to be explicit but the sight of blood from myself is something i crave because it make me feel human im writing this slightly intoxicated because i know sober me would cringe at me writing about this but now i just cant hold it in i cant tell anyone i know so im just spilling it here to be honest i need to hurry before i sober up sometimes i take moment where i just listen to music and think about thing in too much depth i think about how much i want to die but im scared of what happens after death i am not religious but i feel like there is not nothing and i am terrified of whatever is to come and even the thought of nothingness is not comforting to me the idea of my soul or mental character just disappearing forever is something that is so horrifying to me for it is all i am the idea of my mere presence not existing anymore is such a foreign concept for it is all i know i know myself over anyone and everything not that i think i am superior but i am the only one ever to know my thought anyway this is nonsense i cant write anymore despite me having so much more to say i just needed to write some jibberish thought for anyone who read this please tell me what to do thanks,1
it s too hard to formulate thought when it s shrouded by depression,1
last night i experienced another one of my episode when i wa in the shower i must 've spent over an hour cry i could n't take it anymore i remember repeating the word i need help unfortunately i did n't get much sleep last night i laid in bed wide awake and eventually binged watch one of my favorite show on hulu until i eventually got sleepy which wa around daybreak when i woke up i decided to call and seek some kind of help i called my doc 's office and they hooked me up with a therapist that 's located in the same building i actually felt like a heavy weight wa lifted off of me i 'm going next wed. i really hope this work i 'm kind of looking forward to it but at the same time i 'm nervous a hell and for some reason feeling a bit embarrassed i 've been dealing with depression and anxiety since i wa in middle school and i 'm sick and tired of it i want it to stop i 've watched mental illness ruin my family and i want to control mine but i 'm too far gone like some people in my family it 's already ruined the first half of my life i 'm about to turn in a few week i 'm just tired of dealing i wish i never had it i had several hobby that i really enjoyed but thanks to depression i have n't had any interest in them for a long time my depression ha already ruined friendship relationship school and job the last thing i want it to do is ruin my love for writing music art and traveling if depression were a person i would kick it in the throat i want it to die and never come back i 'm sorry for the rambling but i needed to get this off of my chest,1
i have nothing i hate school my parent are either helicopter parent or fucking alcoholic i wish i could disappear i 'm thinking about dropping out or killing myself,1

hello there everyone i know this is a very strange weird title but i need someplace to at least vent or something i am gay and have been with someone for year after about the 2nd year in our relationship a dark secret wa unveiled to me that he wa trans and wa a she well i thought i could deal so went along and it got worse and worse a pretty huge event happened last year where we got arrested for selling pot for money for the transition and i took that a my leave even though she took all the blame my charge are to be dropped guaranteed now i 'm back with my family my aunt at least parent never raised me nor wanted ti and i 'm paying rent and so forth here but my partner always wandered why i didnt move back with her we are both disabled and she is living with her mother now my partner ha back issue and i 'm legally blind anyways thing finally came to a head early last month and i got backed into a corner and i finally told her i am not attracted to her a i use to be so now we are going smaller and smaller visit and talk slowly phasing out our relationdhip she is the nicest person i 've ever been with and i fear of not being able to find someone since i 'm on disability and legally blind it just doe n't look good for me and i 'm really depressed a lot about these thing i know it 's ending but it 's scary now i 've been using other method to not think about that including obsessing over hot guy actor and the such and this is where you all are going to find me really strange there is this one and just one serial killer that i am absolutely head over heel for his name is dean corll and i really do love him i hate the thing he did he not only ruined his life but the life of everyone around him and hundred of family member of victim i know there is a fetish for this kind of thing hybristophilia although i dont feel i fit into that category i feel a deep connection with dean he wa a loner shy kid growing up who only had his over protective mother but she absolutely hated gay and would berate them any chance she got divorced her 2nd husband in part to his accusation of dean being gay went to a psychic that told her that there is absolutely no way dean wa gay and even after the murder came to light said he wasasexual and it wa all david and wayne and they framed her son i truly feel that after his mother left texas that he snapped and started trying to kill his desire so to speak if that make sense he never killed gay guy though i would rather not get into specific of the murder here i try not to think of them when i think of him but it 's all just so sad since my slow breakup is occurring i 've been worried about my family interfering with a new potential relationship too a they have in the past my grandma and my father of all people who never visited me just stayed at his mom 's and leech off her and is a drug addict decided to text this guy i wa going to see harassing thing claiming to be my mother another time wa my grandma tried to call my current partner early into our relationship to start drama here lately i 've been thinking about how that could all repeat even though i 'm a grown as adult i 've literally had dream where i found my perfect skmeone and my family scared him off and i killed myself i 've been suicidal a long long time ago i am not now and have not considered it since prior to any of this ness just so we are clear so it 's something down deep that i ca n't shake off that and i feel like i ca n't get anyone anyways due to my eye problem and income anyways back to that stuff like how my family ha been my grandma specifically berating me since wa like it just hurt it 's not really what they think but the way they act that hurt i could be obsessing over my usual crush jeffrey dean morgan keith allan collin stone justin furstenfeld or anyone i see that i find attractive but here these last few week it 's just been dean i 've known about him for a long time but now i just it feel like i ca n't do much without thinking of what could 've been he 's dead wa killed before his crime were known and we dont know of any more victim or why exactly he did it and it hurt i of course feel i have my theory but i just wish i knew i feel if he wa born in this day and age he would 've turned out differently with pride and someone to talk to and vent to like on here i thinking would 've done him a world of good i also think that if i had grown up in that era and been around him that i could 've helped and we would be great boyfriend for each other we both really enjoy electronics and i 'm pretty shy and lonerish myself he liked them younger i love them older i just feel like we could 've had something perfect i hear all the story of what people thought he wa like kind caring and always there for others and when i look at his sweet adorable picture i see that man and even if he wa in prison i would write him and visit him but i wa n't even born when he died how do you fall in love with someone you never met never got to know it hurt so bad usually my obsession help but with my current relationship issue going on it 's just making worse wishing i could ve with dean forever i hope if there is some sort of afterlife that he is there and ha made peace with himself how do you deal with that thank you for all reply even if you all just read it it help me even if i dont make much sense edit is there any subreddit that specializes in like serial killer obsession/lovers aside from hybristophilia a i 've already posted there and serialkillers which banned me for my post would be appreciated,1

hey guy it 's going to be a long one but i just need to vent x200b i 'm a year old who 's been through quite a few challenge in life but always somehow managed to push through i did n't have a very happy childhood because my family wa always struggling financially and my parent always favoured my brother over me for some reason he 's year older than me and ever since he wa or he 's been very troublesome he barely graduated high school stole money from my parent got into legal trouble several time and perhaps my parent felt like they had to focus more energy on him because i wa always a good kid but i guess it taught me to be independent and strong and handle life on my own x200b i graduated high school top of my class and went straight to university with the help of my parent even though admittedly it 's not super expensive to go to university where i 'm from i 'm from bulgaria and i majored in tourism which is pretty big in the city where i live so i thought it 's a good idea however on the first year of my study my mother 's health rapidly deteriorated she 'd been sick for several year prior to that and unfortunately she passed away in at that time my dad wa forced to retire he wa a police officer by the government and it wa taking month for the government to start paying him pension it wa extremely tough moment for u however i got a job and supported u through these tough time i wa lucky that i 'd found a pretty good job a a hotel receptionist with a very nice and understanding woman who ownes that hotel and i went back to working for her every year after that it wa just month of the year but i also still had my study so it worked for me i 've always been the one helping my family my dad my aunt do n't even get me started on her and my brother who 's just a problematic a he wa when he wa a teen x200b but thing were working out fine i put myself through university had a decent job that had promise for a full-year employment after i graduate i wa able to save money even and help my family and i wa relatively calm but thing this year have just been working against me after i graduated and got my official degree i had a sit down with my bos and she offered me to take the position of a front office manager which i wa more than happy to take it did mean more hour and more stress and not so much more money but it wa a year-round position and i wa still really really happy and i wa feeling pretty optimistic for the future but it did not last long in the middle of last summer my dad expressed desire to go move to a different city to where his new girlfriend lived and i had nothing against it because it 's his life and i did n't want to be that kind of daughter and he asked me if he could borrow money from me so he could be there for like a month or so it 's a much more more expensive city than the one i live in till he find some work and i agreed i had some saving and i knew my dad to be a reliable person and that he 'd give me the money back a soon a he can and i thought i had a stable job x200b a few month later though season end and the hotel i work at close but work for me continues and first month it 's alright except for the fact i had to carry pillow up the stair and other crap like that but then at the end of the month when they 're about to pay salary my bos is suddenly like well thing were n't so great this summer so i ca n't pay what i promised but i 'll be paying you euro a month honestly i should have quit right then and there but stupid me did n't i knew how difficult it would be to find a job in winter here so i stayed put and because i 'm pretty frugal i knew i could live on by myself and i did until december when she said she wo n't be paying u at all because there wa no money x200b that wa a huge blow for me because at that point i had no saving left i had nothing left and everyone that owes me money my dad my aunt my brother i 've always been helping them not even really expecting them or pressuring them to return the money and now i 'm in a need of help and there 's literally nobody i just do n't know what i 'm going to do i 've applied to every single ad i 've come across but it take them week to even call for an interview recently i started an english tutoring job but it 's very unstable i get paid per course on the 20th of the month after the course is done and the course i have now i 'll be paid for in march i 've gone on interview and there 's one promising job but even if i start right away i wo n't get paid until march or even april i do n't have any family that could help me all my friend are in pretty similar situation also with the difference their parent take care of them x200b yesterday i gave my very last money to pay the electric bill so i can at least continue searching for a job i 've no food left and i have about euro left i plan on saving for the bus on 14th so i can go to my tutoring job but considering i 've not eaten since yesterday i 'll probably go and buy some potato to bake so at least i get something to eat i 've called my dad and all he say is i 'm looking for a way to help you but then he just doe n't call back he 's even starting to ignore my call i have no idea what i 'm going to do guy i do n't even have anyone to lend me some money i 'm extremely depressed there 's not even anything i can sell and i ai n't pretty enough to prostitute x200b if you guy have some idea on what i could do please tell me i live in bulgaria and there 's no option for me to get some kind of food stamp or social benefit i 've even checked for free food place and no such thing in my city either i 've gotten way more sad for homeless people than ever and i 'm starting to think i 'll end up begging on the street for a fucking piece of bread life 's fucking hard and i 'm at a total fucking loss x200b thanks if you made it till the end but you probably have n't i guess in the hard moment in life you find out who care for you and who doe n't and i get that my family are n't in a great situation either but not even caring for me or trying to help me is horribly disheartening and i 'm definitely not going to be helping them anymore either i 've become this terribly depressed and bitter person which i hate x200b tl dr life 's shit,1
idk i 'm kinda hoping someone disagrees with my point okay so i 'm smart i 've never ever been unable to not understand something a quick read and i can get philosophical about any subject you name i 'll get to why this is the issue in a bit i wa bullied took comfort in a teacher wa raped by him for year straight from to when he wa caught by my principal he wa fired and i wa told not to speak so i did n't i eventually repressed it all and started hearing voice and noise that did n't exist my mom got into an accident in i 'm now and had to have a lot of surgery and homeotherapy because her spinal cord wa exposed and so she wa pretty much always on pain med my father worked abroad to pay for the whole thing and my sister wa in an abusive relationship so i told no one my family 's great they 're nice and awesome and supportive it wa just shit timing i got raped again a very close friend of mine long story short i went to his house early in the morning and fell asleep on his couch fought him for minute and when i eventually got away from him i yelled and we fought but he seemed in shock himself a couple of month later i repressed it and forgot about it when friend would ask why we fell out i 'd say he tried to make a move and i rejected him and i believed it so eventually when he texted me to tell me he wanted to apologise about what happened in person i wa okay with it so i went and remembered and snapped i lost control of my wording and my temper and i told him i 'd never forgive him and that he should just kill himself he did right after i left he texted me i 'm sorry goodbye i freaked out stopped the taxi turned around and went back into the building when i entered his apartment he lived alone his family wa rich cooling water wa filled with blood i killed him eventually i forgot that too i have a habit of repressing what i do n't like month later my family travel for a week leaving me alone at the house a friend of my sister 's got cancer so my mother and sister went to visit and my dad wa abroad i stayed home to watch our new puppy month later i got sent picture and video of someone going into my house petting my naked body very lightly while i wa blissfully asleep it wa during their travel he threatened me rape murder and everything in-between when i tried to call the police he sent me a message telling me to close or he 'd come and rape me and my family he wa n't good at english which made it scarier for me tbh i listened to what he said and sent whatever he wanted until i figured a way to contact the police he got probation and a restraining order wa issued if i pursued for more i would 've been evicted from the country i wa living in so i just let it be month after that wa over at the start of 11th grade the picture get spread i become public property when i 'd go out i 'd get guy telling me to strip and trying to touch me i wa just a body walking a scared cold body i got an eating disorder after random people telling you you 're not good enough and pointing out every mistake in your body doe that i 'm kilo underweight and that 's my highest weight in a year i 'd wear padding and make sure no one from my family saw me naked but eventually they found laxative and we booked to go for a psychiatrist she diagnosed me with bpd from the first session i brushed upon the whole rape thing and she said i should have week of in-patient and take med a a starter i still did n't get the med my family is scared of them so now we 're jumping between psychiatrist i attempted suicide many time always resolving not to last second because i 'd hurt many people in the process i 'm extroverted so i have a lot of friend i 'm good with advice so i have a lot of friend that consider themselves close to me and i try to be nice i do n't have people that hate me that i know of now why i 'm typing this i 'm not going to kill myself now it 'll be a bad time i 'll hurt too many people and i 'll scar my boyfriend but i 'm not not suicidal i 'm just waiting for the right time finally why the smart matter like i said i 've never not understood something i ca n't understand my calculus homework i 'm in advanced calculus i used to understand what i wa taking easily now i just ca n't i know this seems like the stupidest reason of all to be frustrated or see a the last straw but i ca n't understand it i am obsessed with control it 's how i could hide and be fine if i did n't talk i wa fine if i learned the right coping mechanism i could handle everything fine if i could depend on myself i never have to feel alone it just feel like with everything piling on this is the last bit of good i had in me my intelligence i 'm worthless i 'm nothing and i 'm broken not in a delusional way i genuinely believe that i 'm nothing but the product of the bad that happened to me i read because i had nothing else i let my teacher rape me because i craved love i did n't tell because i wa stupid this is all simplified if you 've read this far and are curious for the rest because this is too long lmao just reply i 'll fill you in i 'm not telling you to rescue me or give me hope i know that the future is better than the present no matter what it 's a law of life i made for myself i 'm just asking that you objectively ass with me where my life is going how i am like a a personality and maybe argue with me and my point maybe you 'll change something in my perspective i hope i did n't tire you out with all this reading have a good merry day hope everything turn out alright for you and me,1

i turned today i live in one of the biggest college town in the country when you turn here it 's a big deal i just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friend i 'm not the party type or anything but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with today i received three text more than most day one from my mom my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday in all fairness i do n't have a facebook and i do n't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything but it still feel really sad not to hear back from anyone i guess i 've never been comfortable with having a facebook the idea of being so interconnected which each others life and making daily status update is such a foreign concept to me but i think in not having a facebook i 've sacrificed my social life absolutely anyways i 've spent the entire day in my room with the light off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college there is not a single person who if i called them right now they would pick up and talk to me i 've been fighting with my parent and after a few shared 'unpleasantries are not answering my call because they want we to cool off and understandably so i 've been 'no contact for ever a year with my girlfriend i knew from highschool who i ended up dating long distance when we started college today i made an attempt to call her went to voicemail to ask her if she 'd let me take her out to lunch a friend to catch up but i have n't heard from her it really break my heart that i lost that person who wa my best friend for a good part of my life i assumed she would have remembered today wa my birthday i certainly did n't forget hers anyways if you 've made it this far from the bottom of my heart thanks for listening to me vent edit the reddit community ha been absolutely amazing you guy have been sending me happy birthday wish from all corner of the globe i 've been getting offer for people to buy me drink and some have even given me their cell number to talk/text me if i wa still feeling down you guy are unbelievable you turned what wa a miserable day for me into one of the most memorable birthday i 've ever had from the bottom of my heart thank you for all of you who took the time to help a stranger on the internet thank you your word of encouragement have lifted up my spirit exponentially i ca n't say it enough thank you thank you thank you,1

so i work a a tutor on my campus and today i read an argumentative essay that really got to me to make a long story short i wa reviewing a student s rough draft essay and their topic/argument wa that school should serve le healthy food and serve more snack food they recommended school serve thing like oreo and pop tart instead of broccoli and carrot because student think healthy food taste wrong and doesn t fill them like junk food doe that s not what really bothered me about the essay though it wa a part of it their main argument a to why they are right wa because some student don t get to eat at home and school is their only meal so they should be able to eat what they want i know this student wa talking at least in part from experience but since i can t give personal opinion about his essay just because i don t agree i just had to fix error it really got to me however because what i wanted so badly to say wa that s all the more reason for them to eat healthy and that the reason junk food make you feel full is the same reason it s bad for you but i couldn t i know this is more of a reflection of u a a society with junk food being more accessible to family suffering poverty but it wa still a frustrating thing to read through none the le i figured reddit would have some insightful thing to say on either side of the argument so i brought it to you guy for discussion,0
you sleep hour some night and hour others the grocery store is right across the street but you just ca n't get over there to buy food you need a dedicated blanket for your couch for those time when you just ca n't get up you run out of clothes to wear because you just ca n't make yourself do the laundry dirty dish pile up in the sink even when you do manage to run the dishwasher because ypu ca n't manage to unload it you come home from work and just lay down on the couch because you have no energy to do anything if you 're unemployed like me same but a soon a you wake up sometimes you do make it out of bed and onto the floor the door is just too far away you buy book game etc and they sit on your shelf because you do n't have the energy to read them you regularly go day without leaving your apartment you get a solid hour of sleep and still feel exhausted you think of thing you normally like to do and just do n't care to actually do them when you do you just get bored and do n't get any enjoyment from it you hear the phone ring and just ca n't be bothered to get up and answer it you try a hard a you can to think positively but everything just feel dull and grey when you do well you just feel apathetic and that you only did what wa expected of you your goal in life is to minimize suffering instead of maximizing enjoyment you 'd be okay if one day you fell asleep and just did n't wake up even if you do n't actually want to kill yourself everything in life just feel like a burden even eating you ca n't remember a time in life where you truly felt happy moment of pleasure are scarce and fleeting you do n't take vacation day because there 's nowhere you want to go you hate being around happy people because it just reminds you of how bad you feel you take antidepressant and see a therapist and it doe n't really help,1

i miss having a close connection with my friend i hope you guy are all having awesome day i 'm just gon na rant here for a second okay i used to have a tight knit group of friend at my old community college we would spend every day together and i remember looking forward to every day because of it we just enjoyed being around each other and it made every day fun last year i graduated i transferred to a university in the same town but i had one friend move to a different state another friend is moving to another state in a week and after this quarter my closest friend will be most likely moving out of state a well i do n't get to see them very often a it is and i miss these guy we truly care about each other i miss having that close connection throughout the year i 've realized that the friend i 've made at my university is just no substitute for that since we all live in the same dorm there end up being a lot of drama sure i had drama in my last friend group but it wa n't anything a common or petty a this it 's le of a i-want-to-hang-out-with-these-people type thing and more like a i-live-with-these-people-so-i-better-get-along-with-them thing there 's so much talk that i feel like if i make one wrong move or say something weird they 're going to find me annoying and not want to talk to me i understand that this in itself it incredibly petty and i realize that these people just make me self-conscious it 's spring break now and i 'm thinking i 'm just going to have to distance myself from all of my friend this quarter we 'll all be moving out soon anyways so i might a well get used to spending le time with them i wa hoping to find a roommate for next year but it might just be best that i go out on my own plus i 'm taking harder class and it would probably be beneficial for me to focus on my study anyways thanks for letting me rant let me know if you 've had any similar experience or any advice or telling me im being overdramatic or something,0

i just wrapped up a project exploring the power of human conversation through photography there is such an intimacy in the photographer/subject relationship that few other interaction can mirror when a subject sits for a shoot they thrust themselves and their vulnerability under the spotlight baring all for the lens opening up to whatever it may capture good or bad trusting the photographer 's perspective being sincere and genuine in their expression for the photographer there is a reciprocal attempt to be honest with their subject to try to capture them a they are to try to view the subject a they view themselves for the duration of a photographer 's shoot the world stand still nothing else matter but the subject in that moment every ounce and atom of the photographer 's undivided attention is directed towards their subject they listen to their subject so intently with their lens that they sometimes catch fleeting glimpse of their soul what if this wa how we conversed what if we talked like we photographed i have been obsessed with this notion of conversation for the last few month obsessed with how to approach conversation for a specific purpose the benefit of conversation the different form it take this photography project began with the intention of capturing the essence of various participant but it 's since morphed into something more we typically began with coffee/tea where introduction are made and the project is explained after minute of casual conversation we move the conversation to the photography studio where i shift ownership of the conversation to the participant talk about whatever you want i usually tell them and the exchange that followed ha been one of the most powerful most humbling experience of my life to date in that dim and private studio i have listened to grief i have listened to pain and suffering and frustration i have heard ambition and i have heard passion i have heard happiness and excitement and hope the hill and valley of everyday life i 've met heartbreak and then watched blossoming love chase it away there is something so so powerful about an open ear about someone just willing to listen without judgement someone willing to block everything out and completely focus on your life experience for a few moment often time the participant would open up immediately with very little effort a if they had been waiting for the opportunity to share other time participant were a little more hesitant and had their guard up the balancing act wa trying engage in that beautiful interaction without imposing many time the room wa on the verge of tear many time the room wa filled with laughter echoing out into the hall many time the session concluded with hug and handshake and the forging of friendship many time the participant would express gratitude for the conversation knowing little of how humbled i wa for being allowed that privilege and how therapeutic it wa for me i like to think it helped that the participant and i made a conscious effort to approach the conversation at equal level instead of some sort of saved-savior dynamic i wa not qualified to provide any sort of solution or feedback to thing they discussed nor did i want to nor were they necessarily looking for that i simply wanted to listen and to be present in that moment and they simply wanted to talk and so i 'd like to continue i believe we can soothe the suffering the frustration the anger the pain the sadness that consumes our world today one person at a time one conversation at a time one photo at a time if you or someone you know is interested get in touch with me through the contact page and i would be honored to lens you my ear,0

everyday in high school i see people who can be engaged in certain class and discussion out of what seems like interest sometimes i see or hear about a student who went above and beyond on something or at the very least i notice people who can do work and study for test reasonably ahead of time every time i see one of these thing i feel jealous sad and sometimes almost resentful that i ca n't share this feeling of passion about a subject or school in general a a student trying to go through an advanced curriculum i feel especially out of place my only passion are playing video game and browsing the internet which is more of an escape habit than something i get excited about even video game become a chore some day everyone else seems to have found their way or at least an area they 're interested in whereas i look at various subject and do n't feel remotely interested in any of them college is coming next year and i have no idea what i 'm going to do or if i even have the motivation to make it through it 's been difficult enough pretending like i care in high school any kind of work is just a massive mental chore to get through if it were n't for my massive anxiety and fear of falling out i probably would n't get anything done,1

i seem to have really fallen in love with cooking i guess i needed a new hobby and i found one i keep getting more and more into it over the past few month i always did the cooking at my house but i ca n't stop trying new thing and meal from scratch yesterday i basically prepped and cooked for hour i live alone now and to some it might seem insane to do all that just to sit and eat alone i do n't know what else to do with all the free time i have at home these day though a lot of the other thing i used to do lost their appeal it is cool though because while it is gone once you eat it there is this feeling of pride and accomplishment there http //imgur.com/a/dncnd that wa last night homemade ricotta gnocchi mac cheese with a many cheese blend sauce boiling potato peeling mixing the dough it all take a good amount of time but it really beat the store bough gnocchi so much lighter you can see the gnocchi on it own if you scroll down i do n't know that i should be promoting myself on here but if anyone want i keep posting the stuff i make to my ig account if anyone is interested,0
i 'm too lazy and it 's killing me i am thinking about suicide a lot more lately i mean i always think about suicide it is n't something that pop in and out of my mind it 's just that i 'm starting to convince myself that i should actually kill myself for good now the reason is that i 'm lazy i am a shitty person i 'm so lazy that i only want to stay in my bed and watch youtube or play videogames i only like the good stuff but when it come to work i start to feel really depressed and sad in general i 'm such a piece of shit that i only want to have fun i 'm such a fucking idiot because i could never get a job because i 'm too lazy and i 'm thinking about suicide despite having friend a loving family and being happy in general i 'm a spoiled little idiot there are people that are going trough far faaar worse situation than mine but i still have the courage to post this i 'm useless to the world someone like me could never do anything good except live off of someone else the fact that i 'm like this is ruining me i wa a curio kid i enjoyed science stuff i enjoyed my life i wa constantly asking question to my parent about black hole and the universe and gravity particle atom or whatnot i wa active and full of energy i think that from when i started middle school my life went really downhill i started loosing interest in everything i liked i started to not enjoy the thing i used to enjoy so much sometimes i would just start to cry for no goddamn reason i still do by the way and now that i 'm in high school i really feel like shit i could never do something productive with my life and i know that the reason i have n't killed myself yet is because of my own lazyness and because of my parent that i love more than anything in my life and it would absolutely destroy me to see them sad but now i 'm starting to loose interest in that a well i know people go trough much worse but i really needed to talk about this or well write about this thanks and sorry for wasting your time sorry for typo,1

which is implying that men are letting it happen and are not good enough men for it it 's making assumption that men a a whole are a bunch of enablers who do n't give a damn that woman are raped or harassed or that other men are being bullied that is an insulting thing to imply,0

note i debated about forming a throw-away account for this but ive talked about suicide a bit in the past so i guess it is n't really that big of a deal ive had a rough go these last month i lost my company the woman of my dream my life saving most of my belonging and my support group and friend when i moved mile away back home to my parent house suicide ha been on my mind the entire time and im getting to the point of no return my question is to the parent and the ex on here would you want a suicide letter left to you explaining that there wa nothing you could have done that it wa n't your fault thats this is all on me if you were the ex would you want to hear that i still love you a much today a i did the first night i said it to you would you want to know you are n't to blame and this is all on me that ive though of you nonstop since the moment i left i want these people to know they could n't have done anything i just do n't know if that letter would help them at all or just hurt them more i have n't decided to do it but deep down i feel my day are numbered thank you for your input,1
heroic death fantasy who else find their fantasy put a veneer of pseudo-selflessness over the act of self-destruction i never much liked the idea of dying at someone even if i do get the occasional unproductive flash of dark enjoyment from imagining someone 's guilt for the most part my brain want to create scenario in which my death is the best and most noble solution to a problem and my deathwish remains a secret bonus how neat and tidy to martyr myself in the aid of others while getting out of my life contract and i get to be remembered for generosity rather than my stigmatized illness equated with weakness and sad furrowed brow or a potential long life of awkward mediocrity and resource-sucking my bereaved loved one are left relatively unburdened with anguished thought of how they could have prevented it and with a solid target to blame if applicable it 's a delight to imagine the devilish bait-and-switch the benevolent trickery of letting them think i 'd given up something precious that i would have preferred to keep it 's like unburdening yourself of some hideous tchotchke or hated piece of furniture only for the recipient to gape at your unimaginable kindness i imagine that if i ever were to find myself in a situation like this self-preservation would kick in and i 'd hold my odious life close like smeagol cherishing the ring perhaps someone else would get the dubious glory by bravery or happenstance and i would grieve them and the lost opportunity for my childish need together at least i can learn something about my insecurity and priority from these fantasy there is always an audience not of established friend or family but of weaker connection i 've wanted to impress i gladly and on a regular basis imagine my death taking place suddenly unceremoniously in the company of acquaintance and stranger maybe the idea of the people who already love me being there is anathema because it spoil the joy of dying performatively and reminds me quite obnoxiously that i do have thing to live for,1
depressed teenager had enough of life,1
so i met a girl about a month and half ago and we hit it off really well apparently i did something right because she doe n't like dating she 's never had a boyfriend and she pretty much turned down everyone who ha asked in the past but she said yes to being my girlfriend but the most amazing part is what she said the other day i told her in full confidence that i 'm worried about letting people close because my depression and anxiety hurt people before i told her everything my suicidal thought my self harm my depressive episode and she just looked at me and said well i knew all that going in and i still said yes that wa one of the most beautiful thing i 've heard in a while gave me the first genuine smile i 've had in over a year edit wow holy shit i go away for a day and this blew up thank you all so much i hope all of you find success a well x edit okay i think i 've responded to everyone i hope all is well with you my friend,1
i want friend so recently i found this video entitled how to break bad habit i have this horrible habit of watching youtube/browsing reddit instead of doing my homework so i figured hey might a well give this a try well one of the step to ridding yourself of your bad habit wa to find the underlying cause/reason that you participate in this habit so i did some thinking why do i watch youtube/browse reddit so much and the answer is quite simple i use it to fill the missing social interaction in my life i do n't have any close friend so to make up for it i watch videos/read reddit to feel that connectedness when i do these thing i feel like i am a part of a group like there are other people out there who understand me and would be friend with me and i really just want to talk to someone about this but you know that is n't really something you can talk about to people who are your casual friend ya know,0

anxiety hey reddit how s everyone s day going let s talk about anxiety okay so who ha suffered from anxiety how bad wa it how did you fix it also okay so most commonly when you ask someone why they re anxious they ll say something along the like of afraid of being judged or being laughed at if they mess up and this ha been me for most of my life but it s been a while since i really did stop caring about that type of stuff and since i stopped life ha been so much better it really ha but if i stopped caring why do i still have anxiety most of it is gone but i still have some left any idea why,0
this is why i 'm happy to be paid 20k le just so i can work day hour afternoon shift week i do n't regret it at all,0
anybody else do this if so why and what the fuck you find yourself leading a life of self-imposed isolation full of all kind of self-hate wishing desperately for some kind of validation help or support of some kind wishing your friend or really anyone would actually reach out and give a shit and then when someone doe and offer help or support of any kind you get extremely uncomfortable with the human contact and all the emotional aspect that come with it to the point of getting really pissed off and hating that they even tried to feed you some obvious bullshit lie about you mattering or being worth something and wish people would just go away and leave you the fuck alone thereby continuing the cycle of wanting someone to reach out but hating when they do seriously what the fuck i ve noticed this pattern in myself and i can t understand why it feel like a combination of not deserving it and flat-out not knowing or even being able to begin to comprehend how to deal with actual genuine human emotion like that it just freak me out and make me want to push away even harder which logically i know make it worse but i can t seem to break the cycle anybody else ever felt or dealt with something like this because i m at a loss here,1
my wife wa struggling with depression for about month she attempted overdosing in december but i found out and called an ambulance yesterday she jumped off the roof of our apartment building while i wa out i do n't know why i 'm writing this it might be to prevent others from doing this but i think it is a more selfish desire to just say it i found out yesterday that she stopped taking her medication for about day because the side effect were unbearable i do n't mean to diminish this but i believe it wa mostly in her head she operated normally a far a i could tell but wa fixated on this idea i noticed she got worse recently but i believed it wa because she wa putting pressure on herself to get back to work i guess i wa wrong she thought i would be better off without her that the pain i wa going through watching her wa too much for me i truly believe that when she jumped she wa partially doing it to free me i wish i could tell her how wrong she wa now i feel trapped i do n't see a light at the end of the tunnel for myself but i also do n't see suicide a an option how can i put my loved one through what i 'm now going through i can only hope that the saying time heals all wound is correct edit thank you all for your support i promise that despite the timing of this it is not an april 's fool joke i really wish it wa edit thank you again for all the support i 'm going to see someone today and friday the funeral is tomorrow it 's going to be a rough few day,1
the pile of good thing is not worth the pile of bad thing i 'm not going to do it but i really wish i could i know it will hurt my parent tremendously if i do and i 'm all the family they 've got and i do n't want to do that to them but i do n't enjoy life the pile of good thing doe not outweigh the pile of bad thing to me and i want out i do n't want to have to get up every day and do this anymore ever since i wa a little kid all i 've ever truly wanted wa a successful relationship with a woman and that 's been comically out of my grasp i just wanted to feel validated and accepted to have something work out be it more serious or casual even with someone i can trust and it never ha the people i 've been the most serious about in the last six year or so have just let go of me suddenly without warning because they had a change of heart after giving me every reason to believe they were all in a i wa they always tell me it is n't me but if that 's true if i 've done nothing wrong i ca n't fix it it 's gotten to where i ca n't trust that anything will work out i wa carrying on a more casual arrangement recently that even suddenly blew up in a way that felt very similar i got desperate and started hunting around and met someone online i liked a lot even though it wa going extremely well i just kept waiting for the shoe to drop and this weekend it did she wa n't a ready for all this a she initially thought she wa a complete turn from where she wa before i could see it coming and it still hurt like hell it 's almost humorous i 'm pushing and getting further and further away from the day when i wa more attractive to the kind of people i 'm compatible with who tend to be younger the woman in my area that are my age tend to lead very different lifestyle with very different priority at this point i just do n't see it changing or getting better i have no reason to believe it will my therapist and friend always tell me it might change but it 's getting harder and harder for it to do so a i get older and the only evidence i have suggests that it wo n't why do i keep wanting to suffer through this for year after year after year all i have is my work and i hate it i 'm burnt out on it but have very few other option based on my skill set mostly i resent it going in to do thing often thing i do n't care about or object to philosophically when i get no reward outside of work i do n't want to get up each day and do this shit again time after time after time i want to be free of all that my friend would be fine if i were gone they do n't like me talking about wanting to go it worry them but they have their own life that are fully formed without me they might miss me a little but it would n't impact them much and frankly there are some people in my life that might like to have me out of their hair my ex to whom i 'm frequently in close proximity for social function for instance they 'd never say so but i bet it would be easier for them the only people who would really be devastated are my folk and so i 'll stay for them but that almost make me feel worse like my agency is not my own that i 'm bound to them and i feel like i 'm a sucker for staying in a situation life i do n't want to be in for someone else when no one else ha done the same for me in relationship and no i would n't have asked them to if they did n't really want to be there yet everyone insists i have to stay alive it 's just tough i get little momentary burst of hope but a the disappointment build it becomes harder and harder to even enjoy what i have for the brief time that i have it and it always come back to this the wishing i wa n't here on this planet anymore so i did n't have to worry about any of this the heartache the disappointment the chaos in general of the world which irritates me every time i see something related to the news which is hard to avoid since i work in that field i just want out i want to not have to deal with it anymore i believe i will be in a better place anyway i 'm soooo ready to be done with this shit but i wo n't go not anytime soon because i just ca n't do that to them,1

i have lost the drive to get through life and care about what happens to me and that make me depressed i have been medicated and see a therapist but nothing is working i also have friend and family that care deeply for me but that almost make it worse they 're caring for someone whose ability to care about anything is broken it a if i am a black hole and their caring is matter that just disappears when it reach me there is n't really anything i enjoy and just existing is overwhelming and i am no longer young anymore i am so it feel like time is running out what is the point of living if i see no point in it i am alive because killing myself would devistate my mom and others that care about me but is that really worth it existing just to please others while feeling no pleasure and mostly pain,1
just need to rant i do n't know exactly what 's wrong with me but for some reason i just do n't want to exist any longer i do n't think it 's normal to think about how easy it would to just die everyday but it 's always there i do n't talk about it i used to see a therapist because my sister also ha mental health issue and my parent wanted to take caution it wa useless i can not trust others and i hated the woman they made me see i could n't trust her and she also did n't listen all i got out of it wa the knowledge that therapist can not help me the last time i saw her she told me i wa wasting both of our time none of my friend know i ca n't be open about it because if anyone knew my life would be ruined i 'd rather die than seek help i 'm scared because i 'm not getting better it 's getting worse exercise doe n't help i 've never been more suicidal than when i wa playing a sport daily i do n't know if it 's better now but at least i 'm not cry everyday becoming more numb to the idea life would just go on same a it always doe i know one day i 'll probably kill myself and i do n't know what to do with that information it 's probably bad that i fantasize about writing list of all the people i hate at school who i would never want to come to my funeral but it so satisfyingly vindictive i feel like i have nowhere to go i have no reason to be depressed i just am i know it would hurt a lot of people but the nice thing about being dead is that i would never know i just want it all to stop some people have reason i have no excuse i 'm just pathetic i 'm sorry for wasting your time i just need to put this somewhere i 'm terrified and not ok,1
i 've never been good at cry i 've dealt with my depression for three year now and i 've never really cried about it that wa until this january when my girlfriend who i loved dearly left me suddenly and my grandfather had a bad injury i wa overwhelmed and i could n't help but cry my eye out now that a bit of time ha passed the pain is the same but i 'm unable to cry i just exist and when you just exist it doe n't feel real it doe n't feel like you actually have a problem and that suck i miss cry,1
trying to drag myself on wel i wa doing better until my last friend stole the money i had saved for my life just found out i lost my cash and she is now in a different country wa my only friend in year guess she showed her true color i 'm not suicidal yet i 'm afraid i might become it though since i just lost almost 3k this wa my life this wa going to help me in my new life away from my ex husband,1
how common is it to have constant suicidal ideation for year i 'm not sure when the switch flipped but i ca n't remember the last time i woke up or fell asleep and everything in between without ideation suicide ha been on my mind since i wa a child but i know thats not super uncommon a always i 'm just kind of looking to relate to someone,1

meeting up with old friend ^^^^i 'd ^^^^like ^^^^to ^^^^state ^^^^that ^^^^i ^^^^started ^^^^writing ^^^^this ^^^^before ^^^^midnight ^^^^so ^^^^ha today me and five friend from high school met up for the first time together in over a year when i wa in high school i became really close with a group of girl who were a year ahead of me and they 're really the only people from my high school i keep in touch with despite going to such a small school where everyone knew each other we 're always so busy though so it 's hard to get everyone together we were meeting for dinner at an hip italian food place which i originally wa n't excited for because i 've had italian food too often than i 'm not interested in it anyway so i worked out at school before i met up with any of them and i wa going to meet up with one person around noonish when i called her it turned out we were on complete opposite side of manhattan so instead of being smart and picking a spot to meet up at we decided to walk along an avenue until we found each other this entailed a lot of back and forth and phone call asking where are you until i finally told her do n't move and i 'll come to you we then went to get food and had awesome bacon burger and then we walked through central park in the park we went up and down so many path and eventually got near the area where i always practiced for cross country so i showed her around there we started at the south east corner and when we were finally leaving the park we were at the north west corner and it wa fun with how we left because i did n't feel like looking for a path that actually would leave out the park and so we climbed down a hill to one of the exit instead then we took the subway down to around china town and walked uptown to get ice cream at a place that make ice cream roll then we walked to the strand book store probably the biggest independent bookstore in manhattan and we walked around there for a while i bought a couple of book a pair of corgi sock and an improv game finally it wa around the time we were supposed to meet everyone so we waited at a park and collected our group then went over to the italian food place it wa hard to find seating for all six of u but we managed to get a table and then when we got our food it wa a counter-service style place not a normal italian restaurant the chef wa super chill and making joke with u a she prepared our food the food wa so much better than i wa expecting we all talked and talked for a while since it 's been so long since most of u had seen each other we started playing the improv game it 's called human being if you 're curious and we had a bunch of fun with that then we got desert at a gelato place i got hot chocolate since i love that and i already had ice cream earlier in the day while we were just chilling on a bench outside the gelato place i did one of my trademark activity with my friend which is read passage of a book that are totally normal in a really seductive voice that is always fun and turn into a wild ride we then realized it wa 10pm and passed some of our bedtime we 're old lady despite all being and so we headed for the subway only one of my friend life near me so she took the train all the way with me and then my dad dropped her off at home instead of having her wait for the bus she had just missed it wa so fun catching up with all of my friend even though we have diverse interest and i personally can not mention my political opinion around them since they differ so much we all love and support each other and are all amazed by what everyone is doing we were all the nerd in high school and still have maintained ourselves well a the year have gone on we can have such long and deep conversation about basically anything and it 's awesome we 're all entering actual adulthood now with everyone graduating/going into grad school/getting full time job and it 's so crazy how when we all became friend our biggest worry were test and paper they 're a really good friend group and i hope to never lose them what wa the most you ever walked in a day do you have any weird talent like me and the reading of the book ever go to a place to eat with really low expectation and end up surprised with how good the food wa or vice versa can you get along with people who have differing view on thing than you do ^^this ^^is ^^post ^^out ^^of ^^360something ^^with ^^my ^^goal ^^to ^^have ^^a ^^conversation ^^on ^^here ^^every ^^day ^^of ^^feel ^^free ^^to ^^comment ^^on ^^anything ^^i 've ^^said ^^answer ^^my ^^questions ^^or ^^just ^^talk ^^freely ^^about ^^yourself ^^even ^^if ^^it ^^does n't ^^relate ^^to ^^the ^^post ^^i 'm ^^here ^^to ^^chit ^^chat ^^it 's ^^been ^^days ^^since ^^i ^^last ^^missed ^^a post,0

when i wa it wa so strange to me i have a journal entry where i wrote this is n't who i 'm supposed to be everybody noticed me go from goofy a-student to constantly skipping class and looking so empty and sad i tried to fight it i really did but fast-forward year and the 16-year-old me is gone the intelligence is there just not applied towards anything useful or productive the humor is there sometimes just more morbid and mostly kept to myself i am constantly fatigued unfocused sad irritable pessimistic and anxious the most common coping mechanism i have that give me comfort are food and tv/games oh but i 'm not really like this—it 's my depression that 's what i said for a fucking decade and i ca n't even believe it anymore my depression is who i am now most of the time and it 's been that way for year it 's become my personality it 's become so normal i do n't remember that people are n't supposed to feel and act like this it 's not fucking normal to take a few hour to get out of bed not shower for day and do nothing but binge eat watch tv play game and sleep for day and even week on end i ca n't stand it anymore i just took a wellbutrin again after giving up on it after a week last time fuck it ca n't get any worse i have to tell myself that i have a serious problem and the only way is to get help because if i do n't then i 'm back in that damn pit again feeling miserable yet powerless to ever change it,1

i know it sound terrible but i barely talk to my father anymore we had horrible argument and falling out after i failed out of grad school some year ago and he completely gave up on me would n't even let me come home for christmas initially refused to talk to me after some phone conversation both he and i became very hostile in our conversation everything became a blame game and the relationship got extremely toxic and now we completely stopped talking to each other it got me to thinking how damn depressing it is that people close to you can just decide one day you 're not worth it anymore and just throw you to the wayside and give up on you i mean this had happened to me several time through trying to date but this can even happen to the people you 're closest to i 'd imagine several people end up homeless or in very dire straight because they 're so called family stopped trying to help them once they get to the point where they snap or think you 're beyond help you are screwed even the few relative i do still talk to sort of begrudgingly accept my existence besides my mom who i 'm incredibly thankful for parent have been divorced since i wa i just think to myself how fucked i would be if i did n't have one family member who cared enough about me to not let me go on the street and freeze/starve to death,1

there really is no reason for me to stay think about it i kill myself worst case scenario hell eternal punishment all that jazz best case scenario there is no longer a me that can contemplate the nothingness that come after death i would no longer exist that sound like a hell of a deal to me i 'm only living right now because i know my parent would be devastated if i killed myself that guilt is what keep me alive but what if like i mentioned earlier there is no me to experience that guilt no me to see/be aware of my parent 's anguish maybe i 'm not making any sense right now,1
i grew up with facebook and i would n't deletefacebook any time soon what kind of people are deleting facebook half the comment are if you have someone 's phone number or email address you 're friend but if you contact them through fb/messenger you 're not friend today i learned i 'm friend with zuck fb.com facebook wa just starting to become popular before i turned which is the minimum age for facebook our teacher were telling u not to use facebook because we could accidentally expose information that could hurt u in the future nevertheless many of u made facebook account with fake birthday it wa a big deal if someone turned and could change their birthday to their real birthday i added pretty much everyone i wa acquaintance with on facebook my classmate at several school my friend at extracurricular activity my co-worker people i 've met at social event and never seen again girl on tinder and other people i 've met online in other word i can contact almost every single friend or acquaintance that i 've ever made through facebook the only friend i ca n't contact are those from my early childhood in this scenario there 's no way i 'd delete facebook if i go to a city that i know a former classmate life in i can message them to ask if they want to catch up if i make a new friend we 'd check our mutual friend on facebook and easily have something to talk about if i met someone at a party did n't add them on facebook but want to talk to them again i can easily find them with just a first name i have a total of friend who i know deleted their facebook account this wa year ago and they 've reactivated their account a few month later for my generation facebook 's benefit far outweigh the risk there 's no substitute at the moment i 'm younger than the texting generation and older than the snapchat/instagram generation it 's not like snapchat or instagram are more private than facebook anyway if you 've deleted facebook or at least considered doing so i 'm interested to know your situation if your social life is n't so dependent on facebook like mine is why is that if you 're and deleted your facebook account i 'm especially interested do you only keep in touch with a small subset of your friend through some other medium would n't your friend make plan through facebook and leave you out,0

what skill would you teach to student so i have a half hour slot to teach something anything to odd university student it 's only to show that i can teach rather than to show off the skill that i have which is feeling like bugger all right now so i would love some inspiration from you guy if it wa possible i 'd bring my xbox one in and teach them how to play overwatch but they also have to have a go at whatever you 're teaching them so passing a single controller round to people in minute probably is n't realistic but hopefully that show you how ridiculous the skill can be,0

i just learned about the social credit system that exists in china and it immediately reminded me of at first glance i started to think that this could be a good concept http //www.youtube.com/watch v=aaikh7antik from a legal perspective in order to unconsciously pressure people to obey the law and decrease criminal activity but this can go so badly that this will literally turn into an obedience type of system heck who know if this is what they are planning all along you buy something that they do not like get a low score and your chance of getting a job is lowered you like something that a political party doe not like your score is lowered and everyone see you a lower than low and become a second-class citizen you want to protest or challenge something that is not condoned or not exactly something that the government is in favour of your score is lowered and your voice is meaningless goddamn it it is such a scary thought that some people in the video think that it is a good idea on a surface level but holy hell it is pretty scary on a deeper level almost like a type of story where your every single behaviour is monitored and rated into however those in charge see what can be considered a desirable,0
constant decline at this point everything just seems to be getting worse day by day to the point where i started preparing a suicide note i feel exhausted and ready to give up my body 's scarred and broken down my mind is just done and instead of a heart beat i just feel pain at my chest yet something deep inside of me is just not quitting and while i 'm still here i felt like posting about it hoping some of you could help me through even just a single day a quick background of me a of right now i 'm turning in a few month i 've been neglected by my family the time when i wa n't neglected is when i would be physically and emotionally abused i 've always kept a small circle of friend people who i cared a lot about but would always turn their back on me and completely forget about my existence when i needed their help the most including my ex who acted very cold and aggressive towards me and merely a couple hour after treating me like shit she had something troubling her and only then she started showing love and affection once she needed help herself it 's like a never-ending cycle i keep thinking i 've found people who actually care about me only for them to prove me wrong over and over yet to this day it still amazes me how quickly they forget all about you now here i am again completely alone i feel like i 'm not even living anymore but just existing just killing time while waiting for time to kill me,1

what to do about girlfriend cutting herself due to depression hello reddit this website ha become a savior for me not only for entertainment but genuine advice my girlfriend ha a history of being depressed not officially diagnosed she ha episode of closing herself off due to internal pain and just last night she told me she cut herself because of how depressed she wa i do n't think she is suicidal i believe it is nssi non-suicidal self-injury i 've been telling her to seek professional help for awhile now but she always turn a blind eye to that advice and refuse to go she 's in college right now and i think she is beyond stressed because of the workload besides maintaining her grade she is also in a sorority that requires her to be at every single event so it take up a ton of her time she 's told me she ha trust issue and generally doe n't open up to friend that she doe n't consider to be her closest i 'm at a loss for what to do here i want to handle this properly and make her get better i 've pretty much become the only person she feel comfortable enough to vent her frustration and thought i do n't believe she wa ever abused when she wa young her parent also love her and care about her,1

i 'm posting this here because i do n't really know where else to put it i noticed the sidebar link to suicidewatch but it did n't feel right to start a thread there among all the other people who really need help since i wa a teenager i 've had casual suicidal thought i do n't mean to trivialize suicidal thought when i say that i literally mean casual like maybe you 're driving home everything is pretty much fine then out of nowhere you go i made a small mistake at work today i should just drive into that concrete barrier or i 'll be hanging out at home maybe watching tv or something and think you know you would n't have to deal with anything anymore if you just shot yourself in the head i do n't think there 's ever really intent the thought just come and what 's kind of disturbing is that the thought are almost comforting for a second kind of like yeah i guess that /is/ an option this ha been normal for me for so long every day for year but recently i 've been thinking about how fucked up it is and i feel alone because it 's like you ca n't tell anybody about it or else they 'll immediately go into call-the-cops freakout mode i just had to get this off my chest it 's difficult to have these cavalier thought and feel like a freak on top of keeping a lid on the depression/anxiety/ imposter syndrome to seem normal every day,1

when people screen call so this is also my first time posting into this subreddit so hello i m sure it s not just me who get miffed about people screening call and then texting right after did you call of course i did and you watched me call you a a person who doesn t necessarily like talking on the phone when i call it s usually because it s an emergency urgent or i feel like i m in danger i also hate the fact how text can t translate emotion which can make thing seem passive aggressive can you imagine if you were walking home and you felt like someone wa following you and you tried to call your friend and they didn t answer but immediately texted you after how annoying anyways don t get me wrong i understand people get busy a well and with driving law but even then it s not hard to say hey sorry i m busy i ll call you back i have a lot of older relative and i love talking on the phone with them i guess i just get impatient with people because when i call i m trying to get ahold of them immediately and not waiting for them to text me back whenever they feel like it am i just an impatient person or is texting really not that great anyways i hope you all have a good day edit fixed a spelling problem,0

we are all for the most part victim of an abusive mother and father we are kid and the group ha different father we have been subject to sexual abuse physical mental and flat out neglect i cant speak for the exact level of abuse they have all been subject to but i know for my own it ha been life destroying i will question everything in my life if it genuine or if i am actually feeling certain emotion nothing ha a solid explanation for how i feel in my head a lot of what i talk about will seem pretty scattered that is just the way my though process work i am wondering if i am being too hard on my sibling of which i have no contact with any longer due to their toxic lifestyle and how easily they prey on the one sister i still am very close with and i. the first sign of generosity brings out the worst in them i struggle with wondering if i am the bad guy here for keeping my distance or if i am fooling myself into thinking they are the oppressor and i am just not giving or caring enough i do n't have anyone to vent to so this is mainly just therapeutic for me just an outlet to talk about my feeling,1

i wa a lovely kid a a child i would be so energetic in elementary and hang out with my friend i would always be the happy one the one always positive my friend went to private school a i went to middle school i tried keeping that same energy until one day towards the end of 7th grade all the girl in my class were at a table talking and my friend went over being the follower i am i went over too but when i went over their reaction wa different they rejected me talked about me roasted me the whole time they did it behind my back and i acted like i didn t hear it it wa from that point on it clicked with me that i am actually ugly never in my life have i thought that anything could hold me back that anything can stop me from what i could be but this realization hit me and hit me hard from that very instance i ve decided to just chill out and talk to guy friend to only speak when spoken too to not maintain eye contact when talking to people i know you may be thinking this is a overreaction form this one instance but no it wa not just this the next year i decided to go to a party and i wa roasted by this one dude which consistently said i wa ugly this would continue over the course of month where i would try to go out or be social but then others would just remind me again that your ugly even now through high school i see people with their friend having fun even now that i m on the football team my teammate would be talking about girl and other thing of the like but then look at me and just say what girl could like you i even sometimes get called the ugliest guy at the school i really tried my hardest to improve my look but i feel i have been given these feature from birth i know there is people out there with actual illness and tumor so i feel i should think of my self in this way a it is self depriving but from such a young age of to realize that i can t be social like everyone else without being ridiculed for my look that i can t go talk to girl without them thinking that i m horrendus that i can t be a normal person i have been running from it from 7th grade to 9th but now that i m in the 10th i have accepted my look i get called ugly everyday yes i know that every person is good looking in their own way i felt like i have been keeping this to myself long enough,1
hi i 'm a long-time lurker here i just wanted to say that today is my last day here i do not belong in this subreddit any longer what i 'm saying is i do not feel depressed any more i 've felt this way for several month but i could n't be too sure however today wa my last day with my therapist and it wa perfect timing i have not been on medication i 've only been in therapy since april this wa the first time i ever left my therapist outside of moving away i grew up moving an average of once per year and i think it wa the right decision i do not feel brought down by problem in my life or let my anxiety get the better of me i see door instead of wall i see friend instead of enemy i see love instead of hatred or fear the world ha become beautiful again and i truly believe it will stay that way for a long time thank you for listening edit i came back here and wow hi again i feel so warmed by all of the response you guy have given one commenter asked how i got to this place my answer is consistent therapy and finding a strong support group mostly friend and my family i 've been in and out of therapy since i wa year old after my first suicide attempt honestly i had to really make a conscious effort in my life to improve it maybe i 'm lucky maybe this wo n't last for long but basically what i did wa find out what thing exactly in my life were bringing me down what did i hate being a part of for me that wa religion some people live happy fulfilling life by serving god or other deity but i am not one of them in doing so i found autonomy in my life choice i no longer feel guilty over certain aspect such a my thought on sexuality or perfection but again these are my own realization many of you have stated a hope to be in my position and from they way i 've been feeling and living my life i hope for you to do so a well once again thank you very much for the well wish and congratulation all around hug,1

i understand your perspective and i agree with a lot of your point you are correct in the fact that love can be nurtured and you can learn to fall in love with someone and feeling like these are more in our control then we are led to believe and i agree that wanting to build a future with someone where both party will be happy is not deceptive at all the deceptive part is not telling them the truth about loving them i can understand that falling in love with someone is something that you can nurture yourself into doing but when you do not love someone you do not tell them that you do if you find yourself in a position where you do not love someone but you want to try and nurture that love you tell them exactly that i know in the beginning stage of a relationship the couple doe n't exactly love eachother just yet since those feeling have n't been given time to grow but when you enter a stage where one person ha genuinely fallen in love while the other ha n't that difference need to be communicated if your significant other come to you and say that they love you and you do n't love them back you need to let them know instead of lying to them and telling them that you do if you lie to them you are giving them a false version of yourself and you are deceiving them it doe not matter if you 're trying to nurture your love or ignite that spark you do not lie to them,0

ever since i wa growing up especially since highschool i ve found myself more and more day dreaming or thinking about what i could be or could ve been and this ha been an ongoing thing for me even when i wasn t super depressed like i d get my first girlfriend and she d be away on a camp our school ran then i d think of what we would do during camp and ob over it a if i missed the boat on something big i have trouble moving forward for some reason did i have some form of depression back then or some form of self hatred my depression is in full effect lately and all i can do is day dream in my bed i dont really know what to think,1
a chronic illness i have ibd inflammatory bowel disease commonly referred to a it 's two main version crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis wa diagnosed at year ago my previous interaction with the medical industry wa you hurt this wear a cast be better or you 're sick with this take this pill you 'll be better then at i 'm told take this pill it might work it might not if it doe n't we 'll have to look at other treatment or surgery i asked the question for how long how do we fix it and got the answer well there 's no cure so there are good treatment i struggled for year and finally got some reprieve in the last month and i 'm praying i can stay symptom free now that said my diagnosis wa a huge shift in how i looked at life and interacted with people i 've met some incredible people and warrior during my illness i 've become a stronger person emotionally and really changed how i view people it 's really motivating to see people overcome their illness and do great thing and i live my life with such an intention now i have a purpose every day to heal everything i do i ask is this healing even though i 've been symptom free for year and off most medication for month the knowledge i 've gained is astounding not just around ibd but many other aspect of life nearly in people have a chronic illness do a differing degree some view it a a curse others take the opportunity to make themselves a better person get to know someone with a chronic illness or if you have one take the time to learn about it yourself i met someone at a peer support group that wa shitting on a doctor because he wa explaining the difference between type of medication she said is n't it your job to tell me what need to be done to be better i immediately corrected her our personal health is our own responsibility and nobody el we might need help at time but ultimately we 're responsible for ourselves sometimes you get dealt some bad card but that doe n't mean you ca n't still win the hand,0

really need a reason not to do it i 've been fighting an uphill battle against what i ca n't see a anything other than hopeless circumstance and the despair is winning i 'm disabled i 've tried to reenter the work force separate time over the course of the last year and each time ha ended in a disaster for my health i get so sick and do so much damage to myself trying to work that i get to the point i just physically ca n't anymore i 'm applying for disability but even if i get it it will be well below the poverty line and not something i can sustainably live off of i 've made it through these past year because my at-the-time husband wa picking up the slack a i tried to recover my health but he left me i had to rush back into the workforce despite my health not having been recovered enough for that i did it for much longer than i thought i could because i had to to survive but now the damage ha been done and i find myself unable to work again with no one to help me survive a i try to recover i do n't have family or much in the way of friend certainly not any that would be willing or able to provide for me while i ca n't do it for myself i do n't know what to do i do n't see a way out of this i 'm not capable of supporting myself and i have no one i can rely on i 'm utilizing every resource available a far a assistance go but there just is n't much housing assistance ha a waiting list to get on the waiting list both if which are estimated to be a year long so there is no reasonable expectation of help in that regard and i do n't qualify for medicaid because in my state you must be either pregnant a single mom receiving disability payment or elderly to qualify so i have no insurance and my medical bill keep climbing i 'm buried under inescapable debt i see no way out of these thing i do n't want to be homeless i do n't want to have to worry every day where my next few meal are coming from i do n't want to live in my busted car but maybe even more than all that i just do n't want to have no one anymore i 'm so alone i have a plan and the mean i 'm just hoping i can find a reason not to do it before everything becomes too much living under this constant stress of fear of basic survival need not being met is destroying and semblance of sanity i had left i 've been strong for so long is it really so bad if for once in my life i 'm just not is it really so bad to call it quits when no one need me,1

this might sound silly stupid and meaningless hell i know i am but i still felt like i had to share with someone so today i wa absent to school and i wa worried about being able to do all the delayed homework today but about twenty minute ago i started to think about my friend and how their day had gone the line of thought eventually lead me to realizing that none of my friend had messaged me asking me why i had missed school yeah in writing that sound very clingy but it 's a bit weird to me that out of all my friend which are n't all that many if i may say none of them were concerned over me not going to school and i thought to myself if they could n't take the time to text me about that what made me think that i actually meant anything to any of them i 'm not asking to be the center of atention or the spotlight only for people to actually consider me for a change x200b this wa more of a vent but i would like some sort of feedback if there is any that could be given,1

i 'm so sad all the time i left my parent who were abusive towards me i 'm left with no idea where i would find love i 'm not sure if they loved me and that they just let their ego get in the way my ex left me soon after blaimed it all on me she wa never really a kind person abusive at time a well abandonment issue got the best of me and i hurt my head on purpose that night even though i wa n't really happy with her it still hurt i just wanted to be loved and not left alone i do n't know why i hold on to her when she wa so unkind and then ghosted me i 'm sad because i do n't know if love exists doe everyone i know have so much issue that they forgot to show kindness to people who need it the most or do i simply not deserve it should i just live and die alone i 'm left with no will to get up in the morning no one know i exist anymore ptsd and isolation ruined me i do n't want to get up next morning,1

this is definitely a case of rape and sexual coercion she wa definitely abused and i 'm so sorry for her tragic circumstance but that doe n't make it any le wrong for her for her to manipulate you like that i feel for her she wa most definitely manipulated in the same way but she hurt you and that 's on her you can sympathize with someone and have compassion for them while still holding them accountable for the harm they cause i 'm so so sorry that this happened to you you deserve so much better and it break my heart that you endured something so heinous you seem like a truly kind person i really hope you find healing and someone who reciprocates the goodness in your heart have you been to see anyone about this therapy can be a tough process for some but it will definitely benefit you,0

i miss the way the internet used to feel i started going on the internet a lot like a lot when i wa a young kid and have been a heavy user since so i know that is in large part just general nostalgia but i really miss the way the internet used to feel i 'm mainly thinking back to 2005-2007ish time when the internet wa becoming more of the 'thing it exists a today and idk man it just seemed like there were so many different subcommunities and online groups/sites with their own flair culture inside joke and overall so much bright silliness and creativity not that there wa n't lot of bad thing troll etc etc. now it feel like there 's just some 'big website that feel more or le the same and maybe really small interest-specific blog or page on top of those for me being on the internet recreationally used to feel so much more exciting like you were always discovering new site or community or meme or whatever and more than that it wa almost secretive or i guess people never talked about much internet going-ons or meme irl now with phone and social medium like twitter facebook and reddit tbh the 'real and 'online world have more or le merged or at least finding the divide is much more difficult idk like i said this is all pretty much me just being nostalgic over my childhood and making internet sound much more special and amazing than it actually wa but doe anybody know what i mean/miss the magic of 'old internet culture and web 'surfing p one of my favorite forum ever to lurk when i wa younger wa twimdb if any of you are out there plz say hi,0
if you 're the anxious type or if you know you have a schizoaffective disorder do not do lsd lsd is not spiritual it rewires established neural pathway to other pathway which typically are not related leading to bizarre sensory input and thought process which absolutely can take on a religious connotation but this is a hallucination a trick of funky brain chemistry you are not actually touching the divine even though it can be a hell of a convincing notion given how powerful the feeling and experience you may have on the drug are you probably wo n't get actual lsd which is another great reason not to do it lsd like all hallucinogen can serve practical purpose but outside of a clinical setting they 're basically a useless a a scalpel to someone who is n't a surgeon all you 're likely to do with it is hurt or delude yourself it 's a short cut and all shortcut come packaged with consequence sound like i do n't think you should do it huh i 've done it enough for everyone it 's a great show and hell of a cerebral ride but it is only a ride and not one that 's ultimately worth risking the stability of your brain chemistry,0

im officially unstable i keep getting drunk and making out with my friend when we hang out together which is stupid enough on it own before even taking into account we signed a lease for an apartment together next year and also they 're semi-exclusively seeing someone else i do n't necessarily want it to happen when i 'm sober but whenever i start drinking i keep drinking and i usually end the night not remembering everything super well due in part to my tolerance going down because i havent been eating and then i wake up the next morning and i remember saying and doing thing i wouldnt ordinarily do usually asking for sex which again i would not do normally for a whole number of reason and it genuinely ramp up my anxiety so intensely i want to kill myself except last time we did this apparently at some point after they left i wound up self-harming which really freak me out because i self-harmed by cutting/scratching some part of my shoulder chest and neck with a pair of kitchen scissors and i do n't remember it especially because my go-to ideation is to take a box cutter and cut my neck open so i do n't know if there wa a moment there where maybe i did want to kill myself i do n't know if next time i drink i 'll be able to control myself to the point where i do n't get ridiculously drunk and i do n't know if i 'll try to hurt myself or kill myself again and i ca n't share this with anyone everyone always leaf me when i tell them i 'm scared i might be going to a bad place i never have told anyone i hurt/want to kill myself they always say that they ca n't deal with that kind of baggage which is their choice and it hurt but it happens and it 's how thing go but even keeping it that vague ha always been too much for people so i ca n't say anything and i 'm trying to find a therapist but i reached out to four and two have n't responded one wa n't taking new patient and one quoted me at per session a an out-of-network provider too which is too much for me i do n't know where to go anymore and i do n't know what i might do i 've been cry in wave all day a soon a i can get a moment to myself i 'm on-and-off scared and i do n't know what to do im not stable anymore,1
i have been a habitual pot smoker for year i live in ca and i m so over it i hate that people recommend weed for depression because for me weed just make it worse i have an addictive personality and i am not the kind of person who can just do it every once in a while or even regulate myself to only use a little at night i ve gone through phase when i ve stopped using it and i feel so much better but then i foolishly think that i can reintroduce it and control my use i can t i ll go from just using at night to using during the day when i feel like hey i m not gon na do anything today so might a well get high and then i hate myself for wasting the day it doesn t even make me feel good it used to but now it just make me foggy and unmotivated sometimes it increase my anxiety and give me a bad headache not to mention that i always end up binge eating and feeling worse about myself i posted yesterday about how i finally made my first appt with a therapist i told my husband that i wa finally seeking help for my depression and i think that really made him realize that i m truly struggling while i wa lying in bed he came in and asked me how i wa feeling about everything and i opened up to him about what s going on and how i need to stop smoking weed because i have an unhealthy relationship with it he s never judged my pot use but i know that he notice how often i m doing it i asked him to take away my vape pen he us it too but unlike me he s not getting stoned every damn day he gladly took them so i no longer have total access i m done i don t want this crutch anymore l m tired of using weed a a lousy escape mechanism at least i can move forward from this knowing that my husband is there to support me and keep me accountable,1

i drove a random stranger back to their home settle down folk this is gon na be a long one it wa a thursday morning about three or four week ago and i wa sat in my pharmacology class slowly feeling the impeding doom of an anxiety attack i wa toying with the idea of ditching the class i had after lunch and going home to play some video game in hope of making my day better lunch time roll around and i decide to go home i pick up my favourite salad and drive home i 'm about to dig in when i think to myself m1chael_burnham this could taste time better if you inhaled some dead plant smoke so i quickly roll up and head outside to smoke a i 'm walking around the corner my apartment block is on the corner of a busy main road and a dead end i prefer to smoke on the dead end road i see a girl across the road looking lost and i start repeating please do n't ask for direction quietly to myself i stupidly make eye contact with her and she shout across the road asking where she wa being the nice person i am i decide to explain to her you 're on discovery i chuckled myself a i found myself in a situation i did n't want to be in but that wa fine she cross the street and she explains that she is n't a local she looked desperate lost and scared i ask her where she 's from and she tell me she 's from a town that 's 30mins away and then she just started bawling her eye out explaining that she had been spiked the night before and had spent the most part of the day locked in a strange man 's room she 'd just had to push the guy out of the way with the door a he came back into the room and just ran until she found me she asked if she could use my phone to call a friend he did n't pick up i asked her if she wanted to get the police involved because i know some people are a bit iffy about policemen/women she immediately say no i then suggest giving her direction to the nearest bus station and she say she ha no money she only had a very old nokia phone on her and she wa wearing a hoodie legging and some nike a i looked closely at her i noticed visible bruise on her wrist back of neck i really wanted to call the police but i also did n't want to make her feel like she can not trust me we tried calling her friend again and there wa no answer a i 'm looking around me i see my car parked on the road and i just blurt out that i 'll take her home since it 's only a 30min drive i immediately regret it a i realise i 'm inviting a complete stranger into my car i further explain that i 'll only take her if a friend of mine come with u just to be safe and she wa fine with that if anything she wa grateful we jump in the car pick up my friend who happened to be about a mile away luckily i offered the girl some breakfast bar i keep in my car for homeless people and she just devoured them like she had n't eaten in day again i think about calling the police so i ask her her age just to make sure i 'm not driving a minor and she say sh2es i did n't believe her but she had an expired provisional license on her which confirmed her age i made sure to drive a safe a possible because i did n't want to have a car crash or something with a total stranger in the car how would i explain that one we get to her house and her friend we 'd tried calling earlier wa standing outside visibly freaked out i think they 'd been out together the night before he wa very grateful for bringing her back i gave the girl my number just to keep in contact and she said she 'd call or text to let me know how she 's doing she didnt i feel stupid like i got played/lied to on the other hand i could n't just leave her to fend for herself because if i had been in her situation i 'd want help too i do n't know if i 'm over thinking it but i feel like i should n't have taken her home that i should have called the police and had them help her no one but my boyfriend and the friend who came with me know and i guess you guy now wa i wrong should i have left her should i have called the police tl dr drove a stranger home probably should have called the police to help a she wa far from home and a potential victim of abuse edit forgot tl dr,0

the climactic monster fight in the tomb raider movie ha not aged well like i try not to be down on movie that use older tech to crete special effect they were cutting edge at the time and we loved 'em then a few stand the test of time a well jurassic park still look great hell even the mummy hold up pretty well the imhotep-face in the sandstorm doe n't look cheesy and that 's the effect that would age the worst in my opinion but this tomb raider thing jesus wept big action setpiece with mythical monster and great googly moogly one of them look like a rubber-suit kaiju extra from a godzilla flick and the other look like a downmarket ray harryhausen stop-motion practical effect the scene also ha that shaky-cam style which make it look like the director watched the blair witch project and could n't wait to try it out i have n't seen the flick before so i am not sure how good it looked in the era but here in the mythical land of 2k18 and with my penchant for old movie it look terrible let 's hear your favourite bit of terrible effect in movie,0

unsure how to survive i m new to reddit so be patient with me while i figure it out and i posted this in another thread but unsure if it wa the right one bit of a backstory for you i m almost my maternal grandparent adopted me when i wa year old however i have been with them since i can remember for all intent and purpose they are my mom and dad it s been a rough past few year a lot of cancer and sadness in my family a few year back my beloved aunt and uncle both died they originally wanted to adopt me however obviously my grandparent did instead so you can imagine how close i wa to them it wa devastating my uncle hung himself my aunt died of cancer a few month later then i had my beloved great grandma also pas from cancer fast forward a year another immediate family member who i wa extremely close to also passed from cancer then a year later another one from you guessed it cancer every time it seems to get better my world come crashing down again every since i can remember i have had a phobia of losing my parent i don t mean a normal fear like everyone ha we are talking night terror every night up until huge separation anxiety issue daily therapist session medication you name it still dealing with it today besides that i am wa incredibly close to them both we argued when i wa a teenager but who doesn t they are were my best friend i wa always able to let my mom know how much i loved her but for some reason i found it a little harder to vocalise this with my dad nevertheless he wa my hero and we shared the same dry dark sense of humour and love of food and endless horror movie in october of my incredible and much loved mother wa diagnosed with a rare form of nasal cancer that had spread to her liver we were told there wa no cure and without some kind of chemo that she would be dead in month she flew back to arizona from new zealand for her treatment a it would be faster and her insurance would make it a little cheaper for her out here my dad and i gave her a month head start then him i and decided to pick up our thing and i quit my job and left my girlfriend sister cousin and life behind in new zealand to come back to the usa to look after and support my mom and his wife during this time we were all so heartbroken a yet again the cancer bug latched itself onto our family but this time it wa to the one closest to me devastated is an understatement i suppose at this point i should mention that my dad also had stage emphysema and copd and even though it wa a bleak sounding future he wa actually ok. managed to get around okay wa just a little slower than the rest of u the second him and i landed in new zealand day in he wa hospitalised for pneumonia and for those of you who are familiar with copd know ever sickness big or small to them can be the difference between life or death he stayed in there week wa out for a week had to be rehospitalised again for another week wa home for week and ended up back in hospital again it wa clear his lung were failing and he wa getting aspiration pneumonia again and again he became weak and wa so disgusted with himself that he couldn t even look after his terminally ill wife he went from a man who wa so happy about life and independence to a man reliant on oxygen could barely talk without his lung giving out couldn t walk and completely bedridden in hospital constantly it got to the point where he wa unable to eat because of the aspiration a well so in turn he lost so much weight and in turn because even more weak he wa on a bipap and it did nothing all over the period of month it wa unbelievable we thought he would get out of hospital this last time he wasn t happy back in the usa and no matter what once mom wa done with her chemo and if thing went into remission for a little while no matter what even if he wa still deathly ill himself he wanted to be back in new zealand and die there however he wa told that it would either be intubation life support or hospice and the choice needed to be made fast dad didn t want to live with a tube down his throat but also wa adamit he didn t want to go to hospice a to him this meant certain death unfortunately doctor that night were clear with him that it wa either hospice or intubation for which he would be sedated the whole time a nothing else wa working he wa moved to hospice at 11:30pm this tuesday wa given morphine and ativan to relax him and make breathing easier and died at am the next morning yesterday will continue below in a comment,1

talk me out of killing myself tonight long story coming so ever since i wa young i felt like i did n't belong anywhere at that age i brushed it off a being smarter than other kid i attended a special class for advanced kid but a we all know that is never the case a i got older i looked on social interaction a a skill so i tried to learn that by mimicking others it did help in getting to point i wa able to make beer buddy and have one night stand with girl i looked good at that time which helped that wa around age i noticed however that none of that relationship became true friendship or long lasting relationship some girl liked me because of my look some guy hang out with me because i 'm fun at party and my schoolmate liked me mostly because i could help them at their study i would always have someone to go out drinking or partying with however whenever i felt sad or i just wanted to talk about my geeky interest i never felt there 's someone i can talk to and i wa sad most of the time now a time passed this developed into a full blown depression a my condition progressively got worse i found myself many time sitting next to train track wondering about what it 's like to jump i like to think of myself a self-aware so naturally when it got to that point i tried to combat it i even went to a great therapist and wa fine for a long time however then came graduation i met a girl that night we talked a lot and one thing led to another in a month we were officially a couple that wa my longest relationship at that point she just got rid of an abusive boyfriend and we both loved the idea of helping each other 's suicidalness with mutual love it wa really like a fucked-up romantic movie well nearly year have passed since then i 'm now i really did help her she went from suicidal to pretty stable i got accepted into one of the best university in our country pretty far away from our town my life became a living hell after this since the first time in my life i felt loved by anyone so naturally i tried to be with her all the time this resulted in constant traveling between city in itself this would not be a big problem however to pay for the uni expense i have to work too and i study computer science which is a pretty hard subject but in itself this would be managable besides all of this i became sick physically i do n't know what it is because the doctor could n't figure it out yet all i know is it 's something to do with my bowel oh and it cause terrible pain and hair falling normally the pain is bearable too but whenever i workout which i used to do regulary it wa too much this caused me to do n't go to the gym anymore so i got fat too that one is all my fault i could have eaten better but my negative self image contributes a lot to this story so my daily routine consisted of either studying and working all day or travelling all day and two day a week spending for hour with my girlfriend sound pretty shitty right day by day during this year my mental condition got worse and worse sometimes so bad that i went day without sleeping because i wa to sad to think about anything but dieing at least i still got the love of my life right well i had until today but she told me pretty clearly that she just doe n't fell it anymore so we should break up and i accept that you ca n't force feeling but fuck man we went to so much shit i lived a living hell just so i can support a future together the only thing i ever looked forward to in my life wa making money so i can buy a house and spend all my free time rising english bulldog puppy together bulldog were my happy animal before her and they helped her too look http //www.sunnyskyz.com/uploads/2013/06/f4f5c-cute-bulldog.jpg at this little guy at tell me he doe n't make you fell better but now even

help me please i 'm a year old man from the netherlands who is turning in a few day i 've been dealing with depression for about or year now when i wa a teen my mother did not know how to deal with me because i used to be very hotheaded and hyperactive which led to her and me having daily argument my father wa almost always working so he wa n't often there for me and if he wa home he did n't want anything to do with his kid my sister is a person i have trouble being around she berates me for a whole lot of thing i have very little control over i 'll state why later when my parent divorced i quickly started to blame myself over it because i always fought with my mother and felt that i ruined their marriage i wa quickly starting to fail my last year in elementary school and ended up scoring way lower than the teacher expected me to score middle school wa even worse a i quickly before the person to bully by my class and by a few others which only helped to destroy my already damaged self-esteem and self-worth by the time i wa in middle school my mother had a new husband who wa a very abusive person both verbally and physically he is now out of my life luckily but he gave my mother permanent hand damage he gave my sister a scar on her leg and he damaged my shoulder and upper back whenever i wa n't fighting with my mother or step-father they were fighting with each other i had to go to my father 's every two weekend and half the time during holiday the first few time went well where i actually spend time with him but that all spiraled down once my step-mother came into the picture i started to shut myself in because she wa someone i had never seen before and i could n't trust new people easily already my depression gradually and steadily worsened around that time too and none of my parental figure knew what to do with me my mother and step-father argued with me all the time while my father and step-mother did n't bother to ask me if i wanted to do anything and let me just stay in bed all day long i even stopped joining them for dinner at one point when i turned i wa taken out of my home situation and i wa put in a clinic so i could learn how to fend for myself because no one had tried to teach me and i had literally no skill to do anything while i wa at the clinic i took a brain scan which revealed something about myself that worsened my self-worth even further there wa something wrong with my brain for whatever reason my brain is always overactive and take up a whole lot of my energy kind of like a burn-out over my whole life i got berated by literally almost everyone a lazy when it wa actually a medical issue fast forward some time and i wa in court a a year old because i originally wanted to remove any form of parental right over my father because he did n't bother to do anything for me because he did n't know what he could do but the judge ultimately ruled for the opposite after asking me which wa that he wa forced to seek contact with me around that time i learned that i am bisexual with a heavy preference for men which i confided in my mother with her promising to not tell anyone i quickly learned that that wa the wrong choice a not even after a week everyone on my mother 's side of the family knew about it my sister literally wanted to cut off all contact with me for being lgbt which she only did n't because her boyfriend told her to stop being so stupid this resulted in spiraling even further down into my self-loathing and completely destroying my self-confidence and self-worth and i wa put on antidepressant however i wa quickly taken off of them after telling them i started to see mental image of very gory self-mutilation when i turned i wa discharged from the clinic and now i live supervised in a home with other people my father had stopped contacting me completely the moment i turned and by then my mother divorced her second husband fast forward uneventful year of me trying desperately to get out of bed in the morning my grandmother on my father 's side died which resulted in me and my sister both regaining contact with our father the contact between him and me is alright now and i 've stayed at his home for new year a few month back the relationship with my mother is now okay again and we do n't fight a much anymore however that 's pretty much all the good news that ha happened my sister and i still barely have any contact my mother and i barely have any contact and even though my father and i are on good term again the contact is sparse financially i 'm having trouble almost every month a because of my brain problem i 'm unable to work and i 'm not eligible for a disability check because i have worked in the past so i should be able to hold a job and now that i 'm turning in a few day my alimony ha stopped a well i 'm having more trouble than ever to try to get out of bed and go to bed at a reasonable time i wa put on a different brand of antidepressant but i could n't bother taking them anymore because they simply did n't do anything i have one person on this world that i am able to really trust and he life on the different side of the earth i just do n't know what to do anymore i 'm unable to allow people close to me and when they do i mask my feeling without even thinking about it i do n't feel like i have a purpose to be alive on this world i do n't know if people say they care about me if they really mean it i feel alone abandoned with no hope left people tell me to look for a hobby to occupy yourself with but even that 's out of reach for me when i get tired after doing grocery at a store minute away from my home i 've ended my time with my psychologist because eventually she started berating me and telling me you need to start finding something to do during the day and you need to start working on a sleep schedule a if i do n't understand that and the professional therapist i would 've gotten literally said the following work to me you can not be depressed because you said it with a smile i think that i have no purpose on this earth and i 'm beyond help i 've been tethering on the edge of ending it and be done with it for everyone 's sake or cling to the almost fake hope that someone will find me pick me up and help me through my problem edit i forgot to note a few thing the few friend group i 'm in i tried to reach out for help multiple time even and every time it end in one of two thing tough love and people telling me to get over it basically and that i 'm being over-dramatic or people completely ignoring me,1

killing myself tomorrow i m trying to pick the best way to kill myself i don t have access to a gun so i wa thinking of overdosing i live only with my boyfriend and we really don t have many medicine in the house except for midol and sinus relief benadryl i wa thinking about going to get a huge bottle or multiple bottle of tylenol and take all of it a well a the midol and sinus relief that both contain acetaminophen is this a sure way to die there won t be anyone to come check up on me from 3pm-12am so i ll have that amount of time to die hopefully will this absolutely kill me or will i just end up in the hospital how many mg of acetaminophen is sure to kill me without a doubt,1
i ve never tried asking people about this because it never seemed like a real thing i just realized that i m much more depressed around the january early april month all three of my overdoses happened between these month a well a other harmful thing what i m really asking is if there s a good way to combat seasonal depression where i live at in pa it s hard to get outside and do much when the weather is a shitty a it s been but i feel so trapped if i can t go anywhere i just don t want my depression to get bad enough this winter to cause me to od or something else i might regret idk if i could go through everything for a fourth time,1
a few week ago i finally opened up to my parent about my struggle with depression and anxiety i m a freshman in college going to school far from home so the next weekend my parent flew me home so we can make a plan to help me my parent had me speak with a psychiatrist and i wa diagnosed with major depression and general anxiety i am now on lexapro a medication to help treat both i ve now been on this medication for exactly day i took a half dose the first couple of night and have since taken full dos every night i wa told that i won t actually start feeling a difference or getting better on lexapro though until after the first two week it can even take a month or month to really start noticing a difference my psychiatrist though told me that if i feel worst or have any alarming symptom i should make her aware i m suppose to be monitored all the time when starting lexapro but i can t until i find a therapist since i m not seeing a therapist yet i had to make my friend aware and they re now checking in on me several time a day i ve been experiencing a lot of nausea though which is normal the first two week i ve also been extremely tired i m unable to leave my bed in the morning or ever really and i have major mood swing some moment i feel very lively and positive but than i quickly change i will become overwhelmed with sadness all at once with no trigger and want to self harm and even die before taking lexapro my feeling of depression were pretty much the same a they are now this extreme moodiness though is new to me and rather alarming i ve also had two panic attack since starting this medication this isn t out of the ordinary for me i get panicked really easily i m just not entirely sure if this is just who i am that i really am this sad and moody or if the medication ha something to do with it these sudden deep feeling of sadness are really scary for me i m trying hard to stay positive and at least make the two week mark but i become really delusional and act rashly when i become very sad i just don t trust myself to not hurt myself at those low moment i m just really lost right now and i m frustrated because i ve finally opened up and i m still in the same place i wa before telling my parent,1

im an awful person for wanting to kill myself i 'm even worse for wanting to get caught before i can actually die i want to kill myself outright i 'll say it i want to hurt myself so badly that i die but i do n't actually want to die i just want to be caught and saved i think it might be because i want people to know just how much i 'm hurting and word are n't cutting it i know it 's selfish of me i think it 's because i want to be convinced that i 'm worth saving i keep isolating myself i 'm addicted to drug i 'm doing nothing with my life my relationship are falling apart i 'm argumentative and i guilt trip the few friend i do have into feeling sorry for me i do n't want people cooing and going aww but youre not awful but i want to be hugged by someone who understands and isnt just hugging me to make themselves feel better i 'm getting off topic sorry anyway the whole point of this is that i needed to get it out there somewhere i want to try killing myself but i dont want to actually die from it what doe one even do in a situation like that how do i convince myself that i 'm not worth le than the air i breathe daily i dont even know if these are rhetorical or not i dont even know what i want out of posting this just needed to get it out there i guess,1

i know everyone here is either trying to help with advice or sharing their story and i am truly touched by everyone s story and i love the support everyone give each other and it truly warms my heart to know that people still have good intention for others but yes there s always a but and i don t mean to discredit anyone but i realize some people are trained to deal or handle u depressed people when really all we need is family i know this sound bad but seriously i ve been seeing a therapist for a while when i feel a more heartfelt connection is through a loved one that actually care and love me and will listen to me not just for my money and for any therapist i m not trying to be rude it s just one of those thing and it s not that my therapist is bad i love my therapist and after all that s what they re trained to do to provide for their family and keep the light on i just wish i felt like my parent my close family listened to me and would listen when i told them about my mental health i guess this is a rant which is why i apologize in advance i know some might be offended and i am sincerely sorry i wa just sold short while other people around me smile at me and all i can do is smirk in sadness thinking what do they have that i don t on paper everything is the same but this internal eternal suffering is ripping me apart so i am sorry for everyone i thank anyone that is going out go their way to read this i truly appreciate you all and i just wish we all loved each other and weren t at each other s throat because big business really rule what our life is anyways i wish anyone that read this and got this far can just be happy i d rather make an impact on someone else s life than waste time trying to fix something that is shattered sorry everyone,1

i do n't believe that life is intrinsically good i honestly believe that i have a right to a humane and dignified death at my current age of simply because my life belongs to me and i want to discard it i feel like a slave every day i have to keep doing stuff to avoid more suffering other people think it 's good that i 'm moving around eating working etc when i wish every day that i had been aborted or miscarried or never conceived it make me want to hurt people talking to therapist is no use because they buy into the religion of life being absolutely unquestionably good when i share my belief i 'm either accused of only having them because i 'm depressed i 've been depressed for year btw or they 'll concede that i 'm making logical sense but just side with their gut instinct that life is great and i 'm wrong when i express my desire to die and the therapist asks me something like what can you do to stop having those thought i just want to strangle her and do horrific thing a philosophical position against life is unthinkable to society i hate people who wo n't allow themselves to understand my worldview and just dismiss me a crazy where is the respect for other people 's autonomy and dignity why do i have to suffer for several more decade because asshole who do n't listen to me or just dismiss what i say have decided that my life is good i 'm the one who ha to experience being me every day so i know better than them what my life is worth it 's garbage for me maybe i could be of use to other people but i 'm not a fucking appliance people 's reason for thinking life is absolutely good are overwhelmingly stupid they do n't comprehend nonexistence they subconsciously think that they will still exist a a disembodied consciousness in an eternal black void after they die that 's why they say that if they were n't alive they could n't do so and such they think they 'd feel like they were missing out if they were dead it 's so stupid it hurt they 'll say that life is good for pleasure and happiness but animal experience pleasure and happiness and these people usually are n't vegan they 'll say that it 's good because you can make the world a better place but if the world ha to be improved upon that 's because it suck they 'll say that if i stay alive thing might get better back to the nonexistence thing i would n't give a fuck about what my life could have been if i were dead life can only have subjective value if you like it good for you but do n't tell me that my feeling toward life are incorrect when something is self-evidently good you do n't have to do all of this manipulative crap to prevent criticism you do n't have to label people crazy or pathetic you do n't have to pressure people to hide their suffering from public view you do n't have to go to freaking therapy to cope with an obviously good thing why are most people so insanely biased in favor of life that they 've made a humane and reliable suicide method inaccessible to me fuck them fuck them so hard i want to keep them alive a disembodied head in jar in a dark room for month and see what they think about life then,1

day that wa my baby my better half falling asleep without her at my side just feel wrong there 's a huge hole in me and i do n't know what to do or how to handle it i just cry i 've been cry since 3pm my face hurt hell my whole body hurt to anyone that ha lost their love how did you handle it what gave you the will to want to go another day or anyone that just want to talk keep my mind off that image not suicidal though could n't imagine putting someone through what i 'm feeling thanks for the kind wish everyone the xanax ha finally kicked in chest isnt hurting so much and i 'm cross-eyed.hopefully be able to get some sleep ca n't take any more tonight i wa able to get a few hour of sleep this morning from the xanax spent today with friend keeping me busy i have n't cared about any of it i 've been out of it just following them around nothing matter to me anymore i know the sun shown today but i didnt notice it i 've caught myself pulling out in traffic without looking not on purpose now but it ha happened a couple of time not sure why i guess it just doe n't matter to me anymore i 'm gon na quit driving for now my school friend said our college ha grief counseling i will be going there in the morning i knoweveryone is trying their best to help me but i 'm just cold cold and hurting and it seems to be getting worse tonight will be rough again everyone is sleeping again and i 've taken my xanax so i apologize for spelling error and whatnot just wanted to give some back story beyond an abusive family she had gang raped losing her son year ago today losing her mother to suicide year ago today she wa the most compassionate person to me she had tried this before before we met we did n't find never did once when i did get upset with her i caught her heating up a lighter tip and buring.her self eith i 'll finish this in the morminf it 's night time again this is starting to feel like a journal i want to thank everyone for their kind word and support being able to read your encouragement and relatable story throughout my day ha helped more than i can express in text today ha been one fucking hard day to put it lightly i got some answer to my question on why what happened did happen and that only raised more question i 'll give an censored cliff note version to keep from airing her dirty laundry in the public but i think it important for me to write this down and i apologize from typing error too been doing this on my phone a my computer is still in the apartment my gf wa n't from here i never met or talked to any of her family i did n't even know their name she told me that there wa a really bad childhood for her and that she had lost child with her husband year back so i never asked question i just listened when she felt like she needed to talk about it eventually she finally told me there wa a younger 3rd child that wa still alive with the now ex husband she said they divorced when the child died on oct fast forward a year her mother took her own life on oct for the guilt of feeling responsible that wa year ago.we started dating in no november of last year she started seeing a therapist for the past month this year that wa a very nice lady that she trusted well then her incident occurs from the guilt and grief she blamed her self for those death which wa completely unwarranted the coroner had no idea of how to get in touch with family so that 's been my goal since then i got in touch with the ex husband and an old close friend of hers from back then i wa n't prepared for theinfo they had about her the reason shed been cry and putting herself through hell did n't exist well her mom wa gone but not for what i wa told there wa only two son and they were both alive she basically drove off one day and never came back that wa a few month before we met she liveds those lie for the year everyone kew her here i talked to her therapist and she wa just blown away all we can figure wa that she wa so much more mentally dustrurbed than any of u had any idea therapist figure she wa delusional maybe borderline schizo there wa really nothing we could 've done to help her given the info we did n't know it wa like throwing a bucket of water on a house fire id here her talking to herself but now i 'm not sure that she wa n't just having conversation with someone she thought that wa there she would tell me about her conversation shed been having with her old friend that she wa able to get in touch with that really have n't heard from her in over a year it 's just so much to process shed actually be excited that she got to talk to them she believed her delusion so strongly no one had a reason to doubt it this just make thing clearer and so much more sad i am doing much better everyone i thank you all for you thought and concern life ha gotten easier a time is passing on for the most part the only lingering effect is the last image of her every time something remind me of her my mind go straight to that that happens quite a bit but hopefully that will pas a the other pain ha to those that have messaged me saying how much this ha helped them it really mean a lot to me i am glad some good could have come from this at least if anyone need to talk please feel free to message me,1

i want to create t-shirt to change the world for better what topic phrase idea are missing on our tee i have a feeling that t-shirt are more than the piece of marketing for brand and propaganda for politician it could serve a much better cause for example shirt played a huge role in branding the march for our life and uniting people across the u around this cause but there are so many more theme out there that require our attention the topic that is being left aside by the t-shirt designer i feel so about ageism a a very unpopular topic even sexism most of the shirt do not educate they abuse the theme imho which topic and perhaps thought you think should be put onto t-shirt so people who see them on me and you would become better human being towards other people animal planet the world please share your thought,0
i 'm trash if my boyfriend doe n't love me again i 'm going to kill myself and even then i might just off myself anyways me being there did n't help him when he wa feeling suicidal it wa the people who hate me who joined a secret club that wa set up because no one wanted to talk to me when i wa depressed and a few of these people even promised not to do this very thing yet my boyfriend doe n't hold it against them that they broke this promise i went to see a therapist but they just told me i needed thicker skin and that there are 'other fish in the sea he say he doe n't see our relationship a 'doomed or 'over and that going to another therapist might fix me so we can be together again i 'm not sure if i 'm going to be able to live with myself anyway what with how i wa n't able to help him and it wa the people who helped beat me down that did i want to go jump off the nearby mountain but i 'm lying to myself that thing will get better he 's currently playing with those same people doing a thing that i told him hurt my feeling even before the brunt of this mess started when the others were just starting to gang up and bash me i do n't care that this is probably toxic of me to still love him i do but he doe n't care and say that i love him to much every instinct of mine tell me to tell him i love him but he say that will just make thing worse,1

spoken language leaf behind artifact within itself look up proto indo european to get your mind blown it 's the name for a proto-language that predates all known language which we have had to reconstruct from all known language for instance the word daughter is almost unchanged over the millennium but the word for son ha changed up who know why i do n't but people are working on this sort of thing there is some process of inference reconstruction and following the artifact and clue within the language itself to determine how far back language go and what it might have looked like,0
my ex broke up with me two month ago and i still don t have the heart to delete his skyrim character,0
it 's a long story with a lot of detail and many instance of assault so i 'll try to sum it up i wa working at a university lab and getting ready to apply to med school research program md/phd after busting my as off for several year and putting in a lot of sacrifice i had a very strong application it helped that i had gotten a couple first author publication in the lab i wa working in the only thing i still needed were letter of recommendation which would n't be an issue the big one though would be from the head of that lab since for those program you need a letter from any lab you 've done significant research in not having one from such a lab is seen a a gigantic red flag by school and typically result in instant rejection i should note that the lab wa very small it wa really just me and the pi professor running the lab long story short she pressured me into a fwb situation when i went on a date with a girl who asked me out my pi freaked out and told me i wa n't allowed to do that that we were in a relationship only in her head and she wa married and that if i tried to end thing she would n't provide a letter or would provide a toxic one spread lie about me in the field to kill my reputation and fire me she had also told me story about how she had broken into house stolen stuff gotten arrested for hit and run and drugged people on more than one occasion so i knew she wa crazy enough to carry through with her threat and probably do more than what she had threatened took me a year to get out of that situation just about everything happened it went on daily and to be clear it wa n't just manipulation often i would explicitly refuse sex act only for her to do them or make me do them anyway i 'd tell her to stop over and over she ignored me sometimes i 'd offer up some physical resistance not enough to leave mark since i knew no one would believe me over her one time she pinned me down and put her finger in my as while i begged her not to a story in and of itself she knew i did n't want this shit when i 'd get hard and hating every second of it she 'd point it out and say shit like see at least some part of you like this ended up moving to another state got a restraining order because she started e-stalking me and still have flashback and dream about it to this day five year later the best part is people apparently ca n't comprehend that this could happen to a man by a woman so you get reaction ranging from congratulation to berating you for being a homewrecker,0
and when i ca n't sleep i just want to die,1

not that there is anything wrong with pumping gas i really ca n't take the adversarial nature of this profession it erodes what little humanity i have left i ca n't stop working a an attorney because i have to pay my student loan i 'm completely miserable i 'm not suicidal but i have often thought of how i ca n't be discharged of my student debt unless i die and that seems like the only logical solution for me to do what i want which is not be an attorney people think i 'm an attorney and it 's all la-ti-da and all this shit but it fucking suck people your client are constantly upset if you do n't win their case other attorney are constantly scheming you to find some back-door way to fuck you and your client over if you 're thinking about being an attorney think long and hard that 's what she said i 'm trapped i 'm miserable i ca n't leave the state because then i ca n't work i ca n't quit because i have to repay the 172k in student loan fuck this profession only other attorney truly understand what i 'm talking about and it 's still taboo to open up about mental health because when you 're screened before becoming an attorney they flat out ask you if you have mental health issue it 's also a fast-track to a disciplinary hearing it 's time to change this bullshit narrative it 's time for other professional to be open i 'm tired of this facade,1
i just set up my course schedule for my second semester and i 'm feelin super excited this is my second try at college after a break year first go went pretty awfully so that i 've now made it through my semester intact and made another schedule it feel super good i 'm just excited in general i guess d i 've made a lot of life improvement in and out of schooling so to make it through the course alright is like seeing all of that work come to fruition,0

by normal people i mean those who seem to function in society with ease who can work full time who can form relationship easily etc i try not to let societal convention get to me but sometimes they do especially now a i 'm getting close to the major thing that upset me a lot is not being able to work regularly i 've been dealing with trauma and ptsd for some time now and it 's been difficult to handle regular work i freelance every now and then but even that get stressful for me i found out today that a client i had been working for may actually be trying to replace me i started to feel pretty worthless a a consequence feeling like i really can not cut it like others can a failure these thought spiral out so intensely sometimes like it did today and i end up with suicidal ideas/feelings of hopelessness for my situation,1
what s up guy and gal you ever wan na tell someone how you feel but you just don t know how like you don t know if you re sad or if you re just tired i could really use some sleep you ever look at yourself and think you re pretty great and then everyone else reminds you that you re really not my mirror say otherwise you ever crack yourself up and realize no one else laugh at your joke i m the funniest person i know you ever meet someone and think hey maybe this will work out for once and then it doesn t and you think of course not why would it sorry for wasting your time do you ever wake up on a nice day and all you want to do is stay inside by yourself why do i feel so lonely do you ever wonder what it s like to trust someone and they don t break that trust must be wild do you ever blame yourself for what other people did to you i m sorry you feel that way do you ever wish them well and wish you were dead because i do,1

apparently it 's not normal to immediately self flagellate yourself for even the most minor of offense apparently it 's not normal to treat yourself like you are worth nothing and to think the very same apparently it 's not normal to distrust any good intention and to dismiss any well meant compliment apparently it 's not normal to observe your reflection and harshly criticize the sloppy construction of your face apparently it 's not normal to assume everyone you have ever met despises your existence and everyone you ever meet will do the same apparently it 's not normal to replay awful memory of you being a terrible human being and consider that you 're still that horrible person today apparently it 's not normal to reject any form of kindness towards yourself because you know you do n't deserve it apparently it 's not normal to want to die who'd 've thought huh,1
i know this probably is n't an uncommon feeling but i want to die but i do n't feel suicidal if that 's even possible like i would never go out of my way to physically harm myself or purposely kill myself but like i would n't be upset if the universe decided to end my life like the idea of getting in my car and getting into a fatal car crash is actually comforting but the idea of dying by my own hand make me feel sick like if i could close my eye and never wake up that would be a dream come true but i would never take pill or do anything else to purposely make that that happen i just feel so numb to life i feel like i 've been numb to life since i wa like i do n't know if i 've felt genuinely happy in year like nothing excites me i just do n't see the point in anything i do n't see the point in living i 've gotten help in the past and gave it my best shot because i did n't want to live life like this i do n't want to live life like this but part of me feel like there is no other way for me to live life i do n't have much i am passionate about i have a heard time forming attachment to people and thing except my cat i love my family and my so very much but sometimes i feel like they could disappear out of my life forever and i would n't feel a thing and that scare me like my grandfather passed away and i did n't feel a thing and i loved him very much my godfather too like i felt sad but not how i should feel i felt robotic like it wa a fake sad and i have a hard time missing them i know i should miss them but it 's hard to miss them i just do n't know i know i need help but i want help but it 's hard to believe that life could be different at all,1

not /u/maiqtheliarr but i agree with him/her so i 'll share my own perspective for the record i enjoy disney movie i 'll even watch and enjoy new one when i 'm in the mood for a feel-good fun movie but i know a couple people that regularly rewatch disney movie i do n't care but i could n't date somebody like that it just strike me a juvenile there 's nothing inherently wrong with liking thing that are marketed to kid like amusement park or harry potter or disney but when that is your main source of entertainment it 's a bit pathetic i realize this sound pretentious but i ca n't understand why those people do n't want to watch film consume art that is more interesting/challenging/thought-provoking/etc just to clarify i 'm not saying that everybody need to watch high brow film all the time or else they 're uncultured pleb i fuck with the lion king a much a anyone i 'm just saying that when people 's favourite movie are the lion king or something i feel like it implies that they do n't like thought-provoking art which again is fine in and of itself but can also be a relationship incompatibility to use an analogy i think everyone here would understand why somebody would n't want to date someone who regularly listens to kidz bop track it 's not that it 's morally wrong or anything it 's just weird,0

procrastinating even with suicide i actually planned to kill myself today i set it up during friday planning my method setting up the date saying monday midnight is my time mentally imagining myself gripping a knife 's hilt with both my hand and thrusting down in my gut imagining the pain it give a i pull the knife upward blood drenching the bedsheet and painting my shirt my blood pooling beneath me and imago like those were playing in my head smiling a i envision it all oh how my mother who would wake me up find me bleeding and she would scream how my sister would find the note left on my desk telling of my plan to not spread word of my death tonight to only say it on my eighteen birthday that i have perished using my own hand within the car i would talk to my mind preparing the note that would tell of my plan and saturday ha came my mind unchanged and finally sunday waiting for the night to cover the land but then something happened a i ready my laptop preparing the letter of my farewell my childhood friend and best friend she had messaged me when we have n't talked for day and with that sudden message i knew someone or something within this world wa watching me they were preventing me of my plan then message of my old classmate friend telling me of how she had missed me so much telling a story of how certain song had reminded her of me and how now she offer to stay up with me till the night and an old friend whom i have not chatted in month had suddenly said hi just really prof of something stopping me tonight my friend know nothing of my plan and so they spoke none stoping me this night but the time i spoke to them ha taken my time of writing down the thing i wan na say before i go i ca n't kill myself without a note i find this unfair truly unfair i feel nothing anymore i just want to die and stab myself but now my energy ha left sleep wanting to take me in her embrace but i ca n't sleeping mean waking up alive and going to school i want darkness i want death why ca n't people die when they ask but still tonight everything i planned doe not go a i say time taken from me energy taken from me feeling taken from me tonight i take nothing of me and certainly not my own life but perhaps i can have taken by sleep,1

the thought got to me i almost did it before i broke down last night at about 2:25am march 31st wa the date where i lost all my will to live i had certain thing happen in my life recently that ended up getting the better of me and i wanted to just not be around anymore then the thought kicked in i become a zombie i had lost all train of thought and no other way out thinking about what i wa about to do all i could see wa the knife the tub and my own wrist i pictured it in my head like you would do if your going to jump from one rock to another and then just end up doing it my mind and body were just put to the test and i feel like i failed it i did n't even make it to the kitchen light before losing it i called any close friend i could to try and talk with while i wa balling my eye out and breathing heavily no one picked up i cant blame them since it wa so late and we have n't really talked on the phone in a while but for some reason i thought the better option wa to leave this earth still i finally caved and called that hotline thats suppose to help u i kept remembering that song logic had wrote what i would see on facebook on some one should always reach out to you and how this hotline would help you i called some one picked up and all i heard wa hello i responded with just sound of tear and out of breath motion and heavy breathing i told them what happened that night why i wanted to do it and what pushed me so far to the edge for some odd reason i thought i would be talking with some one who would be more sincere and lovable and just kind i kept thinking a woman who sound like miss buttersworth would pick up and continue to call me sweetie or baby in a sweet southern accent but no i got some one who did n't sound like that at all just some one who seemed like they were doing their job well what they thought anyways i talked about my problem and what got me leading up to this point but she kinda just kept sticking to one part of the story that i had mention like the whole part wa so important and that wa the reason i wanted to do this i hear a yawn from her here and there like she wa so eager to leave or go onto the next call it felt like i didnt matter at all to this person and that it wa just some bad joke i thought this would be a hotline for help i thought i would get more or just help on place to go to or what i could do better but instead wa just told to sleep it off tomorrow a new day and just get some rest and not think about it i felt numb and completely stupid at this point wa n't sure if i would even wan na tell my friend what had happened what would they say about me would they think i wa fucking bat shit crazy would everyone think i wa fucking crazy you hear this shit all the time on social medium or on the news about reaching out for help but all i got wa a pat on the back and a shitty over used phrase like it would help me to go with my call i wa n't thinking in my head that this person on the other line had to give a shit about me but i just felt like i would be talked out of it more wa i wrong to think this am i just being selfish again and not getting what i wanted should i have just called back i could n't sleep at all i had some friend message me later about a facebook post i had written all it said wa i fucking hate my life and that wa it i figured people would just see it a an excuse for attention or just some emotional kid being too fragile i just could n't believe i had these thought run through my head i wa always the person to reach out to anyone who needed help i wa always the person to be there for anyone and i wa the one to always be the better person but i caved i fucking caved so bad and lost all of my will i wasnt sure where else i could go or where else i could type all my feeling in one this is my first reddit post and it about suicide fuck am i wrong to think all this,1

hey friend today i want to talk about suicidal depression every time there 's a big suicide in the news i see a lot of conversation that make me concerned it seems like depression is a problem that lot of people do n't understand very well i 'm sorry this is so long but it 's an issue that 's very close to me i see people say thing like it wa the coward 's way out or he threw it all away over nothing you should understand that depression is extremely real to people who are struggling with it it 's an illness your brain is n't working properly the same way a broken limb doe n't work properly instead of being unable to walk you 're unable to process positive feeling you 're constantly in a state of sadness or anger or fear or self-loathing this is a lifelong condition for many people you can develop coping strategy but there 's no real cure or universal answer if that imagery is not helpful it 's like having goblin in your brain it 's like fighting an enemy every single day that you ca n't see who make it impossible for you to be happy it doe n't matter that you have all these nice thing and people who love you because you physically ca n't enjoy them or anything else that 's a really hard way to live it hurt me when i hear people with depression described a weak they have to be strong and brave everyday just to leave their house or have social interaction these are people fighting a war that make it difficult or painful to do very basic thing it is tragic when someone dy fighting that battle but it is not shameful the second thing i want to talk about is dismissive solution i love that treatment for mental illness is becoming more socially acceptable however it seems like some people think the conversation end at get help if only he had gotten help why did n't he get help why did n't he dial h-e-l-p on the phone so the helper in the help van could take him to the helpatorium it is absolutely important to tell people get help it is sometimes a little patronizing when it 's coming from people who do n't understand how hard that is i 've seen this taken to a very nasty place where people say thing like it 's his fault for not getting help why should i have sympathy if you 're struggling with depression i want to stress that seeking help absolutely should be the most important thing in your life after basic survival necessity if you 've never struggled with depression i want to stress that seeking help can be much harder than you think it is i have struggled with suicidal depression for most of my adult life i called the suicide hotline back when i wa delivering pizza it is not a magical fix-everything service they told me their nearest facility wa further away than i could afford to drive on my gas budget i 've tried talking about depression to most of my friend i 'm fortunate to have some great people in my life but i 've lost a lot of relationship because i wa open about depression there are people who do n't understand and they get angry at you when their misguided attempt to help do n't work there are people who just slowly back out of your life because talking to you make them sad or uncomfortable i do n't blame these people it is very difficult to deal with someone else 's depression that 's nobody 's fault but it make depression very isolating i 've tried to get professional help many time i 've had doctor who were helpful but we could n't afford them i 've had doctor who were unhelpful and made thing worse i 've been put on medication that made me better for a little while i 've been put on medication that messed me up so badly i could n't leave my house and had to switch high school this is not even getting into how hard it can be emotionally to seek treatment you have to be able to admit your deepest problem to yourself and talk about them articulately with total stranger i do n't know a lot of people who can do that even without depression it is very difficult to seek any sort of treatment at all when you honestly do n't like yourself and do n't believe you deserve to get better i 'm not telling this a a sob story to try and garner sympathy i just want people to understand that everybody struggling with depression ha story like this we almost never talk about them because we are trying to pretend to be normal i hate when post like this are all criticism so i 'll try to leave with something helpful you have so much more power than you think you do to help another person even when you do n't feel like you 're making a difference the smallest act of kindness can really touch people in unexpected way you probably do n't understand depression that is okay we appreciate it when you are honest about not understanding we 're sick of people telling u they understand when they do n't you do n't have to understand you just have to believe u,1

circle of trust wa an interesting experiment but not a fun one i think reddit really spoiled u with the /r/thebutton and /r/place /r/circleoftrust wa intesting and boring for user interesting because eventually ever circle no matter how much effort wa put on it would be betrayed around member by the end of the event a few circle with member existed also betrayed so basically do n't trust over a hundred people at the same time in the internet boring because there wa n't any chat any notification of new member with their name and a limit to betrayal it would be interesting if people held their betrayal it would definitely get some charity circle a lot of member before being betrayed i really did n't want a new /r/place but i hoped for something that would be more engaging we did /r/brasil circleoftrust where i would invite people that post in our subreddit but it wa really boring to manually invite people what do you think could the circle be unbroken http //www.youtube.com/watch v=0e4crth_hb8 and fixed with some change wa the whole concept wa failed for a fun experiment,0

i 'm a living failure i wa forced to go on a trip because my mom did n't want to deal with my grandma 's complaint due to me staying at home but no one ever considered my opinion i tried to go there and get the best out of it i had raised my hope a bit but the higher you stand the higher you fall i remember getting there early in the morning like getting out of here at approx 8am i got there at about and i do n't know during the trip me and my family had an argument when i got there i watched some tv and went for a swim but i spent like hour just sitting on the pool stair thinking and my mom went to talk with me she wa trying to tell me that i need to loosen up but i do n't know i just kept trying to find reason to not do so i did n't even wan na go on the first place then after i wa done i went to take a bath and spent the rest of the day doing nothing then a night fell i went to search for some bug and found a few spider and argo a grasshopper he wa drowning in the pool so i picked him up and set him free but he did n't wan na leave me so he just stood there perched on my finger for some time and i just stood there with him reflecting on everything when i wa just laying in bed playing some guy tossed a used diaper at me i got so mad i 've got some anger issue tbh then i layed down and had some real hard time sleeping i went to sleep at like 2am and woke up by then i spent the whole morning watching tv with my mom 's boyfriend 's daughter and just chatted about our daily life then a i wa going downstairs some asshole there sprayed water on me with a hose and i got mad at him then my mom got mad at me for not doing anything when i went downstairs we had a barbecue and when i went to get something to eat the same guy gave me some skewed cheese even though he knew the skewer wa burning he told me to pick it up and i felt nervous and my mom wa yelling at me about it when i picked it up my finger burnt so bad i practically hurled the skewer across the room it left a pretty nasty burn on my finger when i wa going upstairs to be alone for a bit i picked up an umbrella because it wa reeeeal rainy and at that same moment the wind knocked a bluetooth speaker down from a wood beam close to where i wa and jokingly one of my relative said it wa me and people believed it skip forward a few hour a i went to take a bath i overheard my name and started paying attention to people downstairs my mom saw me looking at them and thought i wa staring at her then she started staring back and got mad at me again a i wa heading to the bathroom i overheard my mom saying do n't mind him he 's retarded and i do n't know why but that really struck me then i spent like a literal hour under the shower just looking at my steamy reflection on a giant mirror they had inside the shower box after i wa done a really annoying kid arrived and started to piss me off i wa holding me back not to throw him inside the pool he 's here right now by the way and every minute he come to knock on my door what bother me is n't even the fact that he 's knocking it 's the fact that he just want to play with my stuff he doe n't want me i 'm just a walking laughing stock for everyone it seems that 's how i feel at least everything i do is funny to someone in some degree i feel like an animal in a zoo like a dog just entertainment on leg at night when i wanted to just lay down on the couch i asked my mom 's boyfriend excuse me so he could let me through but i accidentally bumped into him and he thought i wa just pushing him aside we got into a really heated argument you could touch the tension in the air then i went to sleep and today morning wa just awkward packing wa awkward having breakfast wa awkward everything wa awkward the trip home that kid kept bugging me to play with my psp even though he wa playing on his own phone now i got home and i just stood sat on my bed holding back not to kill myself i 'm sorry if i sounded bratty or played the victim card i just sigh i do n't know anymore,1

what small thing make you feel good i work on a cruise ship and currently there are two of my position onboard the other guy is a good friend and we have worked together before he go off running/gym every day and ha for the past few year where a i don t i like food sleep wine and whisky i m not inactive at all a my job is in theatre so there is always something physical to be getting on with however i m not exactly fit today on my way back from getting coffee at the back of the ship i bump into this friend running on the open deck come on pick up the pace matt he joke well sure fine why not get back to my cabin change out of my uniform and into my running stuff that have been unused in a fair few week and catch up with him some min later i m still running at his pace and if it wasn t for some bad life decision could of kept going i ran on the open deck with a friend throughly enjoying myself and life now for someone who hate himself physically i m quite proud,0
why do people care about me honestly why i know that my family care about me and i have one or two friend but i ca n't understand how anyone could tolerate this thing i hate people giving me compliment because i disagree with them so much and do n't even see how i could be a decent person let alone the shitstain i think i am i know that this is a stupid thing to bitch about other people here have parent that just do n't care at all and have much worse problem than i do i 'm just a selfish self-centered cunt and that just make me want to end it even more if i ca n't appreciate people who care why even bother sticking around just to eventually hurt more people when they try to get close i do n't feel like i can ever change i 've lacked motivation to do thing for a while i wa decent at swimming quit that i wa decent at school now have shit grade i keep consciously doing these thing that i know will just dig the hole deeper but keep doing it anyways because i hate myself i do n't even envision life out of high school because i do n't think i wo n't kill myself by then actually being someone and taking on responsibility and living life scare me i pretty much stick to myself which is why i barely have any meaningful friendship which i 'm tearing apart pretty quickly so i probably come off a a arrogant narcissistic asshole who think he 's too good to talk to everyone else i think i 'm an asshole but it 's not because i think highly of myself i 'm either scared of talking to people or just do n't care about others either way i loathe one of my most basic personality trait i think about being normal a lot but i really just do n't want to be myself because i know there is no normal people tell me that i 'm a good person because i 'm not a dick to people but not being bad doe n't inherently make you good it just mean you lack the spine to have a strong opinion on anything and are just an empty husk drifting through life i could spew out more bullshit for internet stranger to see but my class end in five minute probably going to do it soon or maybe i wo n't i 'm a pussy who will probably get scared at the last minute anyways,1

first time posting on reddit like this because i do n't want to bother my friend anymore with the same issue i 've been dealing with for a long time i graduated from a good well known university with a degree in english because that 's the only subject i ever really liked in school worked a few job here and there in my field ie tutoring online classroom assistant etc but eventually i quit my entire life because i wa extremely unhappy scrounging for rent not able to afford grocery etc. left both of my job and moved back in with my mom since then all i can think about is how useless i am how i have no idea what interest me or make me happy or what that would even feel like i want so badly to find my purpose in life but i ca n't help feeling afraid that this horrible system is all we have where we work until we die and work to keep from dying and any kind of personal sense of fulfillment is a plus i 'm an intelligent individual and i feel like i should be capable of functioning a an adult in society but i ca n't i have severe social anxiety to the point where i put on a social performance when i 'm at work/school and feel exhausted once i get back home i try to be a creative a i can at home since i 'm not working but even the hobby i enjoy do n't truly make me feel happy or like i have value this might be a weird side note but i took lsd for the first time a few month ago and have been feeling like i can see through the societal cage that we all live in that most people are unaware of but i ca n't find a way out please i need help i 'm so exhausted of living like this and i have so much to give to the world but i do n't know how to make it happen when i feel intrinsically worthless and drained of motivation,1

walk 100km in about hour or le if you 're serious although id like to point out this challenge is more for just the average joe not ultramarathon runner or athlete like that cause still more that welcome to do it you 'll find it be fairly simple i say this because it really test what mental strength/resolve you have and your capacity to not let your mind take control of you btw forgot to mention this it is through very steep and hilly terrain you 'll find that you are far more capable of thing you thought never possible like to point out that i am fit but nothing extraordinary and so pitching this at everyone when i did it i had a pretty bad itb injury right from the start which wa soon compounded by cramp massive blister and fairly bad bum rash from which i started bleeding from at about 60km in i wa gon na quit by then but i just 'fuck it and kept going see what happens in the end our team finished in hour but by no mean wa that easy i went to a really dark place during this run it wa about 4:00am i wa literally falling asleep while walking we were very close to the finish but by now the pain wa pretty bad and it wa then when i started to figure out who i really wa it wa probably first time in my life where i wa really angry bitter and frustrated for no good reason this wa n't a pleasant experience but it definitely open up my eye to certain part of my character that normally i would n't have known existed anyways my objective here is not to say look at me in my whole team everyone had something of some sort which inhibited their ability to walk properly and faced their own battle but to rather demonstrate that if you put up with a little bit of extra pain you are capable of achieving so much more this ha now extended into my every day life making me realise more of my potential and to not be afraid of adversity of any sort maybe there are other way of experiencing such thing but to me this type of event will definitely challenge one character mine wa called kokoda challenge on the gold coast but im sure if you live in other part of the world you can find something similar,0

my ex threatened to commit suicide in april he always talked about how his thought on suicide were different from other people 's that he did n't think dying wa that big of a deal he told me several time and seemed extremely serious about killing himself this april i eventually coaxed him into going to therapy last year but after a month of session he said the therapist had judged him to not be a risk and managing well now i 'm pretty sure he wa either lying to me or to his therapist after therapy he still talked about committing suicide and had picked a date- the 15th iirc there is a no-contact order between u imposed by the school a there were a lot of issue between u at the end of our relationship he wa also my bos on a huge project so i ca n't contact him or his friend or family there are professor that i think i could tell maybe the dean of student a well who worked on the sexual harrassment case between u he really did screw me over last year and fucked me up emotionally but i do n't want him to do this to himself i know it sound like he wa a manipulative person in general and people often use suicide in their manipulation but i have a terrible feeling he actually meant this i do n't know where to turn,1
best way to go i just ca n't stop thinking about dying and it 's kinda got to the point where i started to think everything through not just method but the pain felt through them or the way that i 'd just end up a a number and well what 's the best way to go painless easy quick or long hard and painful or somewhere in between is it better to go out a way commonly done or to try to go out in a crazy ball of glory just would it be better to be completely forgotten afterwards or go out in an insane way that get talked about by desensitized people online for year maybe it 's my way of keeping myself from doing it but i just wanted other people 's opinion,1

why should n't i honest question it 's not even that i 'm sad or hurt it 's just gotten to the point where i do n't even remember what it 's like to be happy or to be anything everyone dy eventually there 's no point to life a it culminates in the same end for everyone no matter what i could see wanting to live if i at least enjoyed living but every day for a long a i can remember ha been the same struggle to wake up struggle to get up struggle to do basic life thing there 's no more enjoyment in making music playing game doing thing outside solving problem or maintaining friendship or relationship literally nothing i 've done for year ha brought me happiness or fulfillment it 's not even that i do n't see a future for myself i 'm doing ok in school in what should be an interesting rewarding and challenging field but that too only brings tiring indifference i am certain that if some deity told me for an absolute fact that the rest of my life would be like how the past odd year have been i would kill myself on the spot the longer i live the more it seems that i do n't need a deity to confirm that for me at what point do i just cut my loss i do n't need encouragement or some kind of emotional appeal i want to want to live i need fact and reason i ca n't feel but i can think i just need something to convince myself that it 's worth it to keep putting myself through this so why should i keep going why is life going to be any different in the future how can i suddenly find happiness in thing i do n't care how pointless that happiness is i just want it otherwise there truly is no point,1

psych ward well i got so close to killing myself and chickened out at the last minute had a whole bottle of klonpin in my mouth snapped out of my fugue state and then called for help spent some time in the psych ward but that did n't really help much i still want to die but my bf ha locked all of my med away from me and i can not access them without his help the only thing i can still think about it dying they say i should go back to the psych ward but what good would that even do im in school and i have to work i ca n't just walk away from that to top it off i have been diagnosed with bpd and bipolar disorder it is too much for me to handle and i am tired of fighting i wish i had just swallowed the damn pill,1
i want to attempt and fail and i want people to know about it i ve come very very close to attempting suicide multiple time in my life but i ve never quite been able to go through with it for the last few year i ve been le actively suicidal and instead i just really want to fail an attempt and be admitted to hospital so everyone will finally take my mental state seriously instead of just assuming i m a bit anxious or lazy i don t want that kind of attention but i need everyone especially my school to understand,1
go cold turkey on the soda because at first even a few glass will bring back the craving after a while the craving will go away and soda will seem ridiculously sweet and nasty replace the soda with big glass of ice cold water with squirt of fresh lemon or lime some people like to put in a bunch of mint or cucumber slice but i find that too much hassle and not worth it depending on the water where you live you might want to invest in a filter or use bottled water where i live the tap water is excellent so i just use a few metal water bottle kleen kanteen or similar and keep them in the fridge i also have big 18oz half litre glass so i can pour out an entire bottle refill it and put it back in the fridge it s the simple logistics that help to create the routine a for the caffeine it s possible to ween yourself off that a well or simply quit i went cold turkey on coffee and wa fine after a week or so the body simply adjusts i do drink load of tea though which doe have caffeine but not a much a coffee doe if you want you can choose tea that have le or even no caffeine like many kind of green herbal tea or instead of tea you could do fresh mint or slice of ginger i drink all of these but my staple is regular english breakfast tea with milk if all of this seems foreign to you don t worry if you simply do it for a while and stick to it you won t want anything else soda are foreign to me now and sort of disgusting instead i crave my lemony water and my tea it simply becomes the new normal,0

a the title explains- i 've been having a really hard time at my job over the last month i started working here month ago and immediately i felt the stress build up i wa very lucky to be given the job i have been given- i am underqualified and my bos took a huge chance by hiring me the truth is i 'm not very good at it and the stress of working full-time in such a demanding role ha been slowly destroying my mental health x200b this year i wa also diagnosed with complex ptsd from year of childhood trauma i 've had a pretty significant trigger that spurred some feeling and negative emotion that i 've never really dealt with before i 'm also dealing with flashback pain and panic attack on top of this i 've also been diagnosed with pcos and ibd coupled together these issue and my work have created a deep depression that i have never felt before and i have become erratic and suicidal i think about suicide all the time and i think about it in a way that scare me it started to feel like a real option x200b my therapist and i have talked this over and she agrees that i should quit my job take some time and then find a new part-time one but the truth is i feel trapped i feel like i do n't have the resilience to quit and that the only option is to stop everything to stop this i ca n't physically bring myself to walk into work and speak about this to my bos who is very intimidating the thought of doing that cause me so much anxiety and depression but the daily work also cause me so much stress i feel stuck lonely and without hope,1

kinda i asked my parent what they thought about depressed and friendless people indirectly i told them that there 's a guy in my school that 's depressed rather than saying it 's me i wanted to see their honest opinion i asked them if they 'd befriend such a guy aka me help that depressed guy do you know what they said no they said that depressed and lonely people are that way for a reason and they should stay alone they said that the do n't want to be contaminated by their depression they said they are lonely for a reason and they should stay that way they said that i should n't be friend with that guy in school aka me because he doe n't deserve having friend because he must be f cked up to have been friendless and lonely all his life i feel like sh t. i will never open up again i 'd rather wear this fake mask all my life the only reason a to why i 'm alive is because of my parent and this is how they feel about people like me i 'm even more confused than ever,1
some thought before i leave please hear me this will be stream-of-consciousness thanks in advance for your patience in reading can there really be free will do we really have choice i m starting to think that everything we are and everything we will ever be ha already been decided since we were born poor kid with abusive parent pick being gangmembers not because they chose to be bad but because they were dealt a shit hand in life you could even argue that the kid who grow up in terrible situation who try really hard in school and end up defying all odds to go to college had that in them all along it wa in their gene in their biochemistry conversely someone with privilege and financial resource who is beset by neurotic gene an unattractive physique conditional love from parent and peer and a history of failed connection and lonely night is forever screwed and telling that person that they just need to try harder or that they need to choose to be happy end up doing more harm than good since it put the blame on them and compound their neuroticism and self-hatred i have been given this analogy by a therapist you are a cup and your love is the liquid in the cup if you seek external love and support without loving yourself first you can only give a small amount of liquid since there isn t much there at all but if you learn to make self-love a habit your cup will fill and eventually overflow allowing the people around you to receive your love without sacrificing the love you need to give yourself but to that i respond what if your cup is so empty that you don t even have enough love to motivate yourself to start trying to love yourself the way i see it at a certain point external intervention is the only solution my problem are a catch-22 in order for me to receive unconditional love from other people which is a human need like air/food/water i need to have already received love in order to have the confidence to show my true and relaxed self to the world and to give people the attention that they enjoy so i can t get what i need without already having what i need i have several friend who when i confided in them about my problem tried to empathize with me by saying i used to be where you are. but how did their story improve for one friend a beautiful girl wa interested in him in early adolescence and they had a long and intensely enjoyable relationship he then had lot of love in his cup and he ha never wanted for sexual/romantic partner since she saved him another friend hadn t ever even kissed a girl until college but that changed when he discovered alcohol and went out to bar and got shitfaced he ended up in sexual situation without remembering how he got there and he also eventually met his longtime girlfriend that way they hit it off while he wa sloshed my conclusion then is that for some of u there is no way to realistically solve our problem by ourselves they are just too insurmountable some outside intervention is necessary now if you re thinking well it s only insurmountable because you re telling yourself it s insurmountable trust me i ve been there i have spent year trying to resist the entropy within myself the problem is it never get easier if your external world doesn t meet you halfway it never get easier every day is hard and there is only so much hope one can have before they are completely overcome with despair i am rounding the cusp and peering over the cliff into the void death terrifies me the idea of my consciousness and my story being silenced forever is so confusing and horrifying to me but i am between two pile of shit and i want to pick the one that will smother me sooner i don t even know if i ll be able to go through with it if nothing change by the time my parent die i ll go find a cliff somewhere beautiful and quiet and i ll call everyone i can think of to say goodbye and it will finally be time to end my story and face the unknown but i really don t know if i ll be able to go through with it when i think about that fear and the possibility that suicide might not be a solution for me either i feel so claustrophobic and like i m backed into a corner with no escape life is truly hell one more counterargument if you re thinking to yourself you just need to wait it ll get better i promise you may be right it s hypothetical who know i m sure that there are plenty of people out there who have had sad ending but maybe i would be one of the lucky one but here s the thing how long do i have to wait this argument worked when i wa in high school but it s almost a decade later now i m rotting and if you gave me the choice between more year of suffering in exchange for year of happiness when i m old and my body doesn t work anymore and the people who i m attracted to are even le interested in me than they used to be i m not so sure what i would pick a of now i m thinking i would pick the cliff here s another way to look at it would you tell a dying plant that they need to try harder or change their mindset no you d give them some fucking water thanks for reading i want to love you but i do n't have it in me anymore i 'm a shell,1

suicidal why are you here ah because of the title i assume there s really no easy way to talk about suicide is there which is why i am going to skip the bullshit about life getting better it doesn t life is fucking worthless and it s going to keep on being for the rest of yours and it is for everyone you aren t alone but you ve become a greater person and accepted that you have no meaning and that you should just… kill yourself hear me out alright now don t take me wrong i am not an advocate of self-harm depression and suicide i am just here to help you find yourself in this complicated mess of teenage angst and heartbreak i m talking out of experience here just so you know i ve been and continue being depressed and empty for about two year it s turned me cynical bitter but i still do have something in me that cry out for a normal life and even though the cut on my lower left arm have slowly faded with time i occasionally create new one not because i am depressed not at all in fact i like it guess i m a bit of a masochist aren t i most people even though their pride prevents them from admitting it have or will sometime during their life suffer from some degree of depression perhaps your pet died your parent your wife i have no way of knowing and i understand that i have personally never lost anyone really dear to me except for both my grandmother only one funeral made me cry i can tell you that that s not the reason for my depression by the way the reason the thing that everybody want to know what is depressing you but i can tell you for me it is fucking nothing zero nada there s nothing that i really have to be depressed about i haven t even finished school yet for fuck sake still i am depressed and don t you fucking dare tell me i do it for the attention let me tell everyone out there that fake depression to get attention kill yourself no seriously you taint my reputation a a depressed person because if you think faking suicidal thought to get that one girl to like you you can go jump off a fucking cliff because there are people real fucking people that go through real depression and it is not always a fun a it is for me i know several people that have either went through or are currently dealing with depression and i can tell you that they re not doing good neither am i but i m still alive aren t i the point is playing on their insecurity and honestly life make you the deserve death because there are people that want to die for real they re just not completely over the thought of that one person caring that one girl caring for you they are so fucking close to the ledge that if you threw cotton on them they would fall off and your lie it can be that cotton another common thing people have told me about my depression is that i just need to talk oh yes i need to talk i need to explain to you how you don t understand what you say you understand you have no idea what it is like even if you ve gone through depression yourself because everyone act differently like take a fucking look at me i wrote this laying in my bed at am listening to sad music because i can t sleep others prefer to cry themselves to sleep some people like to cut themselves and i have been there too my friend cutting cutting cutting it s probably the thing everyone associate with depression it s become a trademark for emo kid fuck you cutting is a way of relieving the pain and not physical pain because fuck you and your physical pain it relief the mental pain the whole reason that you are doing it it take your mind to the present and forgets about the past pain for a minute and i have a couple of good looking scar if i may say it myself upper left arm four visible scar that suit my look lower down a fucking barcode of scar but only the left arm and a couple of stomach scar don t ask but the left arm is interesting because it s only on the other side of my arm it s not on the vein but the opposite around the arm and before you throw comment in my face saying it doesn t work that way let me tell you this fuck you it s not about bleeding it s not about getting scar it s all about the pain and i guess i a bit of a masochist because i like it it feel good to feel some physical pain once in a while i don t cut my arm any more i deal with the emptiness through other mean now oh right before i continue on towards the ending let me explain more about my depression and if you re not interested then fuck off a you please i don t like talking about myself i hate being the center of attention and i respectively hate people who love being in the center of attention they get on my nerve man it started out pretty bad for me i will admit that i got depressed from loneliness i wa single have been for… five year yeah… i listened to depressing music and cut my arm but now i don t feel that way anymore the sadness ha kind of drained from me and left me nothing quite literally i am empty i have incredibly few feeling but those feeling are strong no matter what i never dislike anyone i hate someone s fucking gut i don t like someone i love someone with my whole fucking heart and that combined with my inadequate social skill it make it hard for people to truly understand me for who i am and not for what i say enough about my sad life back to you glorious reader right where wa i i deal with the emptiness now and how do i do that by being dexter morgan i fake feeling it sound so very cliché when you hear it like this but i actually do because i am not stupid i know how feeling are supposed to work i haven t been empty my entire life i ve had late night summer romance feeling for someone that wa probably together with someone else i ve been normal once so what do you do to cope with depression or loneliness cry cutting therapist i don t do that any of that anymore i just take walk it might sound very news-esque like eat a banana to prevent early alzheimer s but it work for me because it relaxes me and allows me to think about thought i don t spend much time on and it make me peaceful and tranquil for once just find a nice long stretch that you think is good plug your headphone in and listen to some calm music work every time for me now that you ve read all i ve told you how do you feel i m not going to twist and turn on the end to make a point about depression and suicide i just want to you to realize how much you actually value your life when i told you in the beginning to kill yourself you didn t you are obviously here it can either mean you ve found something you d like to live for or you re just reading this because it s a text on your favorite subreddit i don t know like i said i m not going to encourage nor discourage anything you re thinking about because i can not tell you what is best for you perhaps you feel so bad that you have to leave this world and that is okay it s your choice but i just want you to think about it for a second before you step over the ledge or pull that trigger is it worth it do you really want to die that badly there s only two answer yes or no yes or no there s nothing in between there s no slitting my wrist is better than dying because it isn t it s just you who consciously made the decision not to kill yourself and if you re not going to kill yourself you can drop the whole thing which is why i m asking you this are you ready to die because if you really are if you ve thought it through and find it to be the only solution there 's nothing else to do at all then there 's something you have n't discovered yet,1

i 'm afraid i 'm going to kill myself soon it 's not something i truly want to do but it seems like my only option here 's some context a to who i am so you can truly see how pathetic my existence is and how desperately i want to be free of it i 'm female never had a real job do n't have my license have never had an actual relationship do n't have a single friend outside of family live at home with my emotionally abusive mother and younger brother am disgustingly unattractive and over-weight have no interest in the thing i used to hold dear i lock myself in my room all day only leaving to eat or use the restroom i 'm not working i 'm not studying i 'm not living all of this because of my crippling anxiety and depression i 'm too scared to work i 'm too scared to get my license even though i can drive i 'm too scared to form meaningful relationship with anyone irl or otherwise i 'm too scared to stick up for myself in the face of my family i do n't see the point in forcing myself to workout or pushing myself to partake in the hobby i used to enjoy there 's no reason for me to leave my room a there 's nothing for me outside these four wall i 'm too afraid to live and that 's why i think i 'm going to kill myself soon these issue have plague me for year even before i graduated high school but they 've gotten progressively worse these past few week all i can think about is killing myself everyday from the moment i wake up to the moment i go to sleep i fantasize about taking my own life overdosing on my anti-depressants and benadryl then topping it off with a bag over my head slicing my forearm and climbing into a hot bath laying my head on the train track every day my year of therapy have n't helped my year of medication have n't helped my stent in a crisis center ha n't helped i do n't see any other option,1
i 'm almost and i started taking zoloft in late-2014 were great year wa my last really great year but slowly declined and culminated in me failing most of my class in i wa maxed out dosage-wise taking mg/day and it wa still not cutting it i tapered off over a few month without telling my doctor because i had lost interest in most thing and thought why not i thought i just had no motivation to take class so i got a seasonal job working for amazon and did that for about five week from november-december i thought that would make me feel better but by the third or fourth week i had become incredibly addicted to adderall i also have adhd and unspecified anxiety disorder to just get me through the day i quit my job right before i got a medical marijuana card and have been able to reduce my adderall intake it honestly doe help with everything but all i want to do now is get high to cope with the depression and that itself ha prevented me from getting a job it ha helped immensely with being able to filter out the noise and realize that this depression is n't going to go away without some other medication my doctor prescribed me prozac last week so now i have the delicate task of tapering off the weed while the prozac hopefully increase in effectiveness over the next few week it just really suck when you find a medication that work well for a while only to have it crap out on you now i feel like i 'm stuck in limbo waiting to feel better,1

i 'm just so done i 've been thinking about how i 'll finally do it all night i ca n't stop my life suck i 'm and have never been with anyone ever i 'm probably the most unattractive woman ever actually it 's sad but it 's something i 've accepted the one thing that get to me more is how in my entire life i 've never really had friend either maybe in grade school but nothing irl since how fucking sad is that it 's my fault too because i have so much social anxiety i ca n't even pretend to be a normal human i did manage to make a few online friend last year but even then i do not fit in they are really nice and normal while i am a shitty person who ca n't even give any advice because i 've never actually lived once they realize how actually awful i am i wo n't have them either even though they know i do n't belong maybe i do n't actually have a problem maybe i 've just wanted excuse to explain why i am the way i am maybe i do n't have depression either but for someone who think about dying all the time ha to have something wrong with them this ca n't just be who i am i ca n't do this anymore i am so tired of dealing with myself and i am tired of everything i 'm tired of being alone and unable to connect with people of not even being able to do adult thing i 'm tired of looking in the mirror and seeing myself i am tired of going to work at my awful job and i am just tired of waking up every single damn day thanks for reading if you did i figured it out and just need the courage now,1
last week my long time therapist committed suicide and i don t know how to cope i feel so alone this wasn t just some therapist off the street he wa highly educated well respected and worked with a few institution selfishly i feel hurt and abandoned everyone is telling me to find a new therapist but not only doe that feel like a close friend died get a new friend but so much trust wa broken i don t want to open up to a new therapist the thought that keep running through my mind is if someone who dedicated his life to mental health and had so many resource couldn t get better what hope do i have and also selfishly how could he i know mental health is a beast and i know from his brief mentioning that he wa fighting demon but it feel so unfair like my symbol of recovery ha been destroyed thanks for listening,1

go to africa or any other 3rd world country do some volunteer work there help out just go see it firsthand i only went to africa because my parent signed u up for missionary trip i dreaded going but i 'm glad i went we went to kenya and we stayed in the nice part of nairobi one of the student we spoke with said everyone call it barbie town i thought it wa because that wa literally the only place we saw white people but she said it wa because barbie ha everything everyone who can afford to live in that part of nairobi wa well off i saw a lot of thing on that trip but the one thing that stuck with me the most wa going to kibera kibera is one of the largest shack town in the world the entrance to it is at the top of a ridge and you can see all the little tin shack that stretch for mile on end while we were there we met the principal of a school that oprah apparently built he showed u his home where he his wife and child lived it wa barely bigger than a storage closet outside of the school the one thing i noticed wa the large group of unsupervised presumably homeless child they were everywhere playing in the street kicking deflated soccer ball on uneven dirt field some of them started following u so we started talking to them a best we could and one of the girl probably jo older than three reached into her mouth and handed me her gum the principal said that it wa a gift for visitor and that the gum had probably been in about different mouth since they all share it when they get a piece these kid had nothing by our standard but still wanted to give it broke my heart after i got back from that trip my whole worldview changed everything that my friend complained about that i used to complain about it all seemed to petty and pointless and ungrateful that trip wa a jarring reality check that i a snotty year old desperately needed i grew a lot from that trip i 'm turning this year and i still think about those kid seeing that level of poverty firsthand it change you on a fundamental level it 's a hard thing to do but i feel that every american would benefit from a trip like that,0

need help.i do n't want to kill myself please bear with me so i 'm been facing really hard time since childhood from being bulllied to messed up home enviornment to resigning from my first job within month last year because of same type of toxic people at work.i wa still doing okay.but day back we had some glass door repair work at home and called a man who take work for installing glass door.to give an idea where i 'm from only rowdy people or corrupt politician could survive either you yourself have to be a badass asshole type criminal or should know someone who is involved in those type of acti ities especially a politician otherwise there is no justice for a simple/common/mango man coming back to that day when the incidemt took place i 'll have to go back to more day back from that day.before calling in this man let 's call him y we had called someone else to perform the job let 's call him x .but x did not make the glass door a per our expectation and wa not responding to our call afterwards so i went to his workshop and took back the advance money deposited with him.now we call y someone who we contacted through another shop nearby our locality.he come in took the advance money took the reference picture with him which i had clicked of the glass door which got shaterred which is why we are getting a new one installed.he promised to install it by the next day.next day he sends his people who were to install it but to our surprise the glass door wa exactly the one which wa made by x and which we had rejected.upon inquiring with the people who brought it with them we got to know that it wa indeed from the same workshop i.e x 's because they get their work done from x 's workshop after this my mother called that person y to inform about this because it did not match the reference picture we had given him and how he could send this glass door without even checking it and he started giving round answer and told my mother he will come within half an hour to our place to look at the problem.he then called his people on the phone who were infront of u and called them back and instructed them to leave the glass there itself i.e our home.after this when again my mother called him to know when he wa coming a it wa already late his tone of talking had already changed and stared saying something rude and started lying upon which i took the phone and asked him strictly whether he wa coming or not and what he would do in this regard to which he told me he will get a new one installed a per our reference photo.after this he sent his worker to our place to take the other glass door with him for proper size reference and design mind that glass size is not too big and we indeed gave it to him in a hope for the satisfactory result.next day his worker came with the new glass along with the old one they took along with them.but we were shocked when we noticed there wa a crack in the old glass which they took for the reference purpose.we immediately called y and he arrived few minute later and asked his people worker whether it wa during the time they were installing the glass cracked to which they replied no.right after this he started shouting loudly that he is n't going to pay for it and started behaving really ill mannered way and became aggressive while walking towards my mother to which i came forward and started shouting on him a well and that went for several minute and i do n't remember much of what he said bevause i literally wa not into my sens meanwhile my mother kept telling me to calm down and not to stoop to his way of cheap talking.even then my mother did not raisd her voice and talked to him with patience telling him not to raise his voice a this is someone 's home not road.after that i told him to finish that work off and leave that old glass and leave the place.i paid his full amount cause that way he got to know his real value because it wa not at all about money we were really calm while talking and would have had even paid for the glass that cracked due to their mistake what really hurt me and kicked my nervousness anxiety and fear is after all these year of coping with the bullying i had at school someone dared to shout and get aggressive in my own home where i thought i wa safe.i feel guilty for not being able to protect my mother 's dignity and respect because of the way he talked.what if he would have had caused her any harm what i would have had done then.i feel powerless feared and isolated today.the person y had mentioned about working at a property dealer 's place nearby our house who ha two wife and is involved politically.these are the kind of people due to whom these y type of shameless creature do crime in the broad day light now again i have gotten into depression and extreme fear that if in future he becomes powerful y and try to harm my family in any way what i will do then because i can not be sitting at home forever.my mother ha suffered for very long in family for different reasons.after he went away i could see her sad although she did say while smiling that do n't mind these type of incident or people and not to get upset about it.but i fear for my mother family even myself.also this incident ha literally shaterred my self esteem and confidence that someone really dared to behave that way in my home took out his frustration and i could not stop him from doing that.why is these type of thing happening with me i am lost.what should i do.i do n't want to live in fear all my life.there is no rule and law .i do n't want to go down the path of becoming a criminal because i feel that is the only way dealing with these type of people i have no more motivation left to live please i need answer,1

trying to get better but ca n't i must not be trying hard enough or maybe i 'm not trying at all i 've been seeking treatment for a real long time and i feel like very little ha improved medicine do n't even help me i 'm such a parasite to family and friend i tried to seize opportunity and option like going back to school volunteer so on but it 's just all overwhelming to me i 've been so depressed with suicidal thought that i barely leave my room these day i ca n't talk to my family about my problem because they 'll just say it 's cowardice i 'm selfish and seeking attention i wa told by them one time that no one like a depressed person also i 've been avoiding them to avoid any further injury and such life ha never been kind to me i 've faced failure and disappointment so much that i 'm too scared to even try because i 'm afraid everything will just hurt me again everything about my mental illness and what caused my mental illness convinced me that i 'm the ultimate failure and everything about that just make me feel worse and worse a if my family making me feel worse is n't enough i really do n't try hard at all all i do is nothing and yet i just want to die i may or may not have attempted already,1

i 've reached that point in my life where not feeling depressed feel weird to me i 'm just so used to that numbing feeling of uuuugh that to actually think of life without depression just make me roll my eye like that will ever be possible i can never just be happy there always seems to be some sort of catch happiness seems to come at a price i 've also noticed that after feeling happy that i just crash hard back into depression and i feel worse than before i sometimes compare happiness to a hard drug the high is amazing and uplifting but you fall from that high deeper into depression and you crave that happiness i 'm also anxious of the time even when i have no responsibility or thing to worry about i could be sitting down on my bed listening to music and then be having an intense panic attack i dunno this might all just be me i just wanted to vent,1
it feel like i try so hard to make my life work out to make my situation fit the frame of my heart but it always end up crumbling back down into disappointment year ago i wa at the beginning of a journey that would change my life and shape who i am today this journey abruptly ended in the most emotionally entangling and confusing way in a bout of fire that burned the love and vibrance that used to exist in my heart until may of my life wa beautiful but ever since it ha been a living hell that ha burned my spirit in a cauldron today my once vibrant ambitious life is a bastion of anxiety attack constant avoidance of trigger i can not avoid that used to be people i cherished and have been a part of my life my whole life of constantly existing in a state of mental unease and turmoil from the beautiful life i once had the beautiful wa too short lived and bounded immediately by the ugly of equal magnitude it is the ultimate mixed bag of bitter and sweet i wa supposed to be graduating from my dream this may but instead college ha just been one failure after another i live in an emotionally broken home of good people that trigger me on a regular basis that i used to have such a warm relationship with i search for job but whenever i do i get this awful feeling in my gut that i am making the wrong decision again i tell myself story to try and make that decision fit the frame of reference of my heart but it never fully doe i know something is missing if only you could get paid more and if life were le expensive the process of moving out would be le emotionally complicated the first time i tried moving out wa arguably the most traumatizing experience in my life i wa self harming on a regular basis and experienced certain experience that are in memory what a virus is to your body i just want peace and the life i once had but that will never happen i ca n't believe i used to not walk around the house constantly with earplug in my ear or that i would n't ever need to listen to white noise i ca n't believe that i can not do the thing i love and follow my heart while being in my home because it emotionally numbs me to anything i value i ca n't believe i used to go to college not to be away from this house but because i wa pursuing a degree i wa passionate about i ca n't believe i used to be truly in love with someone that served a a deep source of inspiration someone i still talk to but that is covered in the traumatic memory of when we got back together i ca n't believe i used to not the shit i deal with constantly but that doe n't matter it make me cringe at how broken my life ha become but it will never work out and nobody really understands i do n't even understand and i ca n't write this out without intrusive thought stemming from the expeirences that occurred in my life since two year ago intruding on my thought and emotionally contaminating what i write i try to keep my head up but it 's like there is an anchor tied to it that always pull it down and society is structured such that the only thing i can do is continuously try to motivate myself and have different method of escape from what is because i can not change it,1
like i feel like i 'm just too self-aware and aware of how others feel about me i feel like i 'm kind of a social chameleon able to shift into whatever i think people want me to be to some i 'm a funny guy to some i 'm someone who will listen to them and not judge for some someone to talk to about tv show for some someone to laugh at i make joke about being depressed the kind of one you see in meme all the time people laugh thinking i 'm just joking but deep down it all true and i 'm just making a joke out of it i 've done it for so long admitting i am actually really depressed would seem insincere but i know it 's getting worse but admitting to people seems so daunting that it 's impossible you know i 've joked about it with my friend for so long that they 'd think i 'm just exaggerating or something my family would be fucking shocked and blame themselves which is the last thing i want all my acquaintance who see me a a nice friendly and approachable guy would think i have some kind of dark side or whatever you know i know exactly how everyone would react to knowing i 'm depressed so i know i ca n't just come out and admit it without fucking thing up but i can just feel it getting worse you know i used to be so smart have goal wanted to make something of myself and leave a mark on the world i 've started thinking the world is a shitty place and nothing 's gon na ever change that and while there 's some beauty there 's always some shit that come with it nothing ever truly work out for anyone you can see it in people most everyone it 's like in their eye man you see people everyday just like me joking about depression or whatever so many damn people depressed almost everyone seems to be to some degree i started thinking recently it 's not even necessarily just mental illness the illness itself is a symptom of how shitty the whole world is now people do n't have hope anymore they just grind away and cling to whatever good they can find family love friendship whatever but some never find it it 's like the autism spectrum everyone is somewhere on the spectrum of being depressed some just become so imbalanced they need help anyway i know deep down i 'm probably so depressed i 'm just seeing the worst in everything but it all just feel so worthless so many people live their whole life unhappy that 's not just illness i think sometimes the world is just a genuinely shitty place and human can be just a shitty too we 're all stuck trying to deal with it to get by and assign some meaning to it but when you see through that it all just seems pointless why try man all i try do in my day is do something for someone each day show some genuine kindness or do a favour anything just to help that 's what i 've started to cling to trying to be some kind of force for good but most of the time nobody will even notice you 're doing anything to help even trying to help is sometimes just not worth it it just feel like everyone 's wading through a pool of shit and are too busy trying to climb out to look around and help each other out the mess it suck,1
my dog just flirted with a cute guy in the bus every time i travel with my dog she chooses one person to flirt with basically she keep looking at them and wagging her tail furiously every time they look back and if they re close enough she try to get to them to be pet this time she chose this guy who sat next to me on the bus luckily he thought my dog wa super cute so we started talking a bit while he wa petting my dog i thought he wa a very good looking guy and the whole time we were on the bus together i wa thinking to myself i should ask his name and number so we can meet up some time but i m an idiot and i m shy so i didn t ask then he got out and he wished me safe travel and he waved to my dog or me who know before he left it wa so sad my dog wa completely confused and kept trying to look for him i m also a bit sad because i have no idea what his name is and i can t find him in any way so i probably won t see him again it did make my day though so it s not a completely sad story and who know i might see him again some time edit added a picture http //imgur.com/bhyenz7 of my goofy dog,0

i think i hit a dead-end my therapist asked me what i 'd like to be in year and my mind went completely blank he told me i ca n't go further in therapy without having goal and asked me to think about them for the next session but i just ca n't think of anything i 'd like to be doing in year i no longer feel pleasure in food booze sport sex traveling i have no talent for art design handwork i like being around people but they drain my energy way too fast my job is boring and predictable but it 's the best i 've had i 'm well-paid and i do n't think there 's anything else i 'd enjoy doing i 've had a couple relationship that lasted over a year but they were never fulfilling to me and i do n't believe in love anymore anyway the truth is i 'm miserable and life a it is seems unsustainable but i do n't know what would even if i were to have the perfect hollywood life i 'd still feel this hole inside me at this point the only reason not to km is all the time and money i sunk into finding a cure and also failed attempt that nearly got me crippled for good what am i supposed to do if nothing in life seems compelling enough to keep on keeping on ha any of you ever hit that wall,1

do you fall in love with stranger for a long a i could remember i 've suffered from falling in love with stranger it happens randomly uniquely and to my chagrin quite easily i would n't say it 's romantic or sexual i struggle to describe the feeling fully it is almost like a bout of intense and selective sympathy/empathy for instance today during my commute i wa wasting time on instagram sometimes you get in a wormhole and click from pic to pic to profile to pic and so on i somehow landed on this gentleman 's profile i saw just a few photo not even of what this person look like just their life and the thing they choose to post and my heart wa full of butterfly it 's like an instant connection/feeling of fondness that is very unique it 's not like i feel this for just anybody i just knew that if we ever got the chance to meet in real life or strike up a conversation we would have an immense connection and without them even knowing who i am i know that i love this person and that i feel so much empathy for their struggle and daily existense this is n't just an online thing this ha happened to me in real life on the bus at the grocery story on an airplane it 's like i see certain people and i feel this very real connection and love in my heart i 've never told any one of these people for two reason because i do n't want to creep anybody out this may be something that is very real for me but not for them you know i do n't want to overstep any boundary and make anybody feel uncomfortable sometimes i 'd just like to let them know that they are appreciated and loved some conversation starter if you 'd like doe anybody else experience this am i absolutely nut for this do you believe in love at first sight do you think it is genuinely possible for one to love a stranger,0

when shit doesnt work out for me and this last road is closed off im killing myself and none of you can stop me im basically on the last road out of hell and it is likely unrealistic for me to expect that there is not a brick wall at the end i am sacrificing everythign i have left and giving everything my absolute all to the point where i do not eat or sleep in order to work without rest until my body fails me my health is in poor condition and i can not even take shower eat sleep or use the medicine im supposed to because every second is a mad-rush to work harder i can not afford failure and every minute count every second of wasted time is a second i will not sleep for day it destroying my performance and ensuring failure in the end at this point since i cant keep it up indefinitely and it all for nothing because in the end even if i overcome every possible odd in front of me there is going to be a wall/hurdle that will be insurmountable at the end nobody can help me and the few who do right now by also sacrificing everything from food to clothes will not be able to help much longer or will die imminently leaving me on my own with nothing no bank account no property nothing not a single family member pretty much everything why even continue why even fight sometimes i say it because im destined to end capitalism and become some kind of communist hero of the people and the most legendary thief of all time who literally steal the future out from under the elite and drive them to be a new underclass but thats just the last bit of my sanity failing me and trying to justify my continued existence for a false purpose that can never be won i 'll probably end up a criminal if i dont kill myself probably even a successful one i wa very good at crime for year being heavily involved in drug for many year and a highly successful kleptomaniac before that never got caught hundred of dollar of shit police who had idea about me because of association or watching my vehicle loathed me because i wa so skilled at defending myself and hiding any and all proof im also a good hacker and highly intelligent in computer science so i can probably be a great cyber-criminal but in the end those road will just lead to more pain so why not just end the pain once and for all why not stop the lack of sleep the endless night and the continuous destruction of whats left of my mind and just off myself already why keep trying for a better future i know can not exist for me let me tell you something unless you can be an exception to the rule if your starting from nothing in this world there is no equality you are nothing everyone will have unfair advantage over you unless they are equally a impoverished your intelligence determination all dont matter all that matter is how many continues you can buy with money thats what this game is and im fucking sick of it seems to me society wa intentionally designed to pit u against each other like dog to limit how many people can become successful sure they give you little catch-22s here and there oh we 'll help under x circumstance but if you dont make every decision perfect and meet all criterion thats worthless to you id rather what little social program and help we get wasnt there at all so that way people would hurt and would be under no illusion that thing are ok so they would fucking stand up and fight about it instead of being pussy,1
i wasn t really commenting on the door opening part it wa the shoe tying part i wa commenting on also i m sure op meant that the guy kept opening door for her to the point where it could have gotten a little annoying i absolutely love it when someone hold the door open for me but if they constantly do it it get a little weird at some point right also you don t need to be that hostile my only hostility wa just that r/niceguys link and even then that wa just being passive aggressive at worst,0

sorry if im in the wrong spot just a quick question i suffer from depression and anxiety pretty severely and am thankful for a decent support system i don t want to end my life but sometimes in my really dark night i yearn to speak with someone anonymous just to get through a really rough few hour or something im curious if there is a hotline esque thing akin to the suicide hotline that is for what might be considered a non emergency relative to someone close to putting themselved in danger i don t necessarily need something immediately but if such a resource exists i would love to have it on deck again i am sorry if this post doe not fit here and will remove it if need be thank you to everyone and im sending my love,1
i guess in the back of my mind i always wanted to be a well known musician so people would actually care if i killed myself and now it 's blatantly obvious that it 's not materializing without effort it 's possible it still might happen of course idk why i romanticized it so much i just wanted someone to give a shit about me i still have a handful of follower on my soundcloud and late last night i had a weird thought about putting out a clear i 'm going to kill myself message on there somehow i decided against it mainly because i do n't think a single person would actually care let alone do anything anyway i 'm going to work i wish anyone cared who could actually help me all my friend are multiple state away my family is a fucking trainwreck which i need to escape a soon a possible and i 'm chronically fucking ill and nobody fucking care down a bunch of drug and get to the next thing seems to be the same of the game,1

job hunting i still did n't find anything i 'm not doing anything all day i live on the money i saved i went back to my parent house to live with them because well i 'd broken up with my bf and yet i always remained optimistic a much a possible i did n't want to dwell on those thought but loneliness wa really hard to cope with i mediated exercised but at the end of the day i did n't have anyone to text or to hang out with and i 'm not the best at finding way to find new way of meeting people i hope finding a job will help but i ca n't find anything yet i keep smiling everyday people tell me i

tonight edit i genuinely did n't expect this many reaction to my post i woke up this morning feeling like my face had been hit by a truck from all the cry and i did n't think of checking reddit because i thought it 'd sunken down in oblivion already you guy definitely restored my faith in humanity and i wish i could all take you out to get whatever it is you love eating/drinking best if you guy ever are in paris i 'd never written something that desperate about myself since i thought that burying the bad emotion within would eventually make them die out i 'm not okay of course but i think i 'm ready to be back on track of the positivity path and i am so happy to read that my post helped some of you you 're all welcome in my inbox anytime for anything i 'll be happy to reply from the bottom of my heart thank you i 'm so grateful so many people read it and took the time to write some nice word to cheer me up you 're all amazing people,1
after typing this out and reading it i should definitely put a warning here this is a pretty graphic description of my suicide attempt from le than an hour ago i tied my belt around my neck and looped it through the space in my closet door where i removed the door knob i sat down and inched away from the closet door until only my elbow were keeping my back from the floor i stretched my arm out in front of me and let myself hang for a few second to see what it would be like when i wa a teenager i tied a belt around my neck and tightened it in a selfish and angry attempt to hurt myself the blood pushed against the back of my eye then i choked and coughed hard this time wa completely different i just started blacking out no coughing not nearly a much pressure behind the eye just a sudden drop in awareness and momentary ringing in the ear followed by the muffled sound of my fan i could feel a shot of adrenaline right to my chest and i immediately sat back up and removed the belt from around my neck i 'm still angry with myself because i did n't even have the resolve to see this one thing through to the end every time i take step towards improving my situation i self-sabotage or give up i ca n't bring myself to go through with simple suspension yet sorry if this post violates the rule it 's cathartic to type out the experience and share it i ca n't post this to /r/suicidewatch since it definitely violates the rule,1
i make list they can be about anything and everything a list of all my favorite books/movies/shows/etc imaginary shopping list of everything i wan na buy but do n't have the money for reason why i really like someone reason why i really do n't like someone collection checklist to do list just everything honestly,0
hopeless i ve always been the type to overcompensate to try keep people around me id be anyone but me because my opinion on myself is that low that no one would like me for me i m currently and feel all i ve had to offer i ve given and i m reaching my limit i m not saying that my reason for wanting to end thing revolves around the lack of company in my life but it s definitely contributing i grew up with a turbulent family life my dad died year ago and that s probably where thing really went downhill for me because it left me with load of regret i don t talk to family about my problem because they have their own life own family own problem to deal with so there s just no time for me really i feel super useless in life and maybe i m just a waste of oxygen a waste of resource i don t know i m just not what the world want or need,1
found out that my gf cheated on me with a close friend yesterday my girlfriend and i have been in a on and off ldr relationship for quite some time now i seriously loved this girl still do she texted me yesterday saying that we needed to talk and then told me that she kissed one of my closest friend yesterday when i asked her why it happened and if she had feeling for him she said that she did for both him and i and that she wa confused i ended up confronting my friend about it and yelled at him for an hour straight god it hurt so bad i have no will to live at the moment and i would honestly just end it all right now if i had the motivation to i don t see the point in being alive anymore she wa the only thing that made me see a future past my 18th birthday the only thing that made every passing day bearable because i knew that she would be there i can t even off myself even if i tried because both my psychiatrist and therapist told my mother to confiscate and hide any hazardous item in the house i feel a though i can t even tell my friend about this either because i kept the last month of our relationship a secret because i wa scared that they would be angry with me when they found out that we were back together i just want all of this to end,1

had an odd dream that is lingering around by lingering i guess i mean that i still feel the emotion of it even though it been hour atleast since i woke up from it this is odd because i rarely rarely remember my dream the only one i ever remember are nightmare thankfully i dont have them often anyway this dream wasnt a nightmare i only remember bit and piece of it but basically it wa about some random beautiful spanish girl and i wa falling in love with her at the beginning of the dream we were on the brink of being in a relationship it wa clear she had interest in me but a the dream progressed she seemed to grow more distant and her interest in me appeared to be nothing more than a short lived infatuation i have had similar dream in the past but only once in a blue moon are they memorable to me i think the reason i remember these dream a well a nightmare is because the emotion in both are always strong anyone else feel they only remember the same kinda dreams/only one that have strong emotion,0
why i dont get it whenever i read reason to not kill myself their all the same people care about you fucking bullshit if people cared why dont they show it do i have to die before they do live for that next big moment and what fuck it up like usual ive fucked myself over time and time again im heading down a path that is not good at all word over the internet have no traction with me i dont know you much le care you could just be a bot i cant tell people dont care about me more so my contribution to society you will have no effect on my decision or feeling there is no posible way to show your compasion to tell the truth im scared if i confess my feeling people will leave me a lost cause my friend will not do anything they dont care every time they hear that someone is suicidal they call them weak attention whore they are all i can get to everyone else i am a one trick pony i can play football but i am socially awkward ugly lazy i hope i die by overdosing ill die a happy death something that is completely void from my life drug seem to be my salvation and hopefully my end,1

i really need some help last year my dad died from a spontaneous heart attack at the age of zero warning one minute we 're just talking about seeing a movie the next weekend and the next morning the coroner woke me up pounding on the door saying he dropped dead in his truck two block from the house on the way to work ironically he wa in great shape and we worked out every weekend he did n't smoke or drink and his doctor said he had the fitness of someone half his age he wa the pinnacle of health at that age and this happens somehow he wa my only family and i 'd been living with him for a few year after graduating college i 'm one of those probably borderline autistic zero social life kind of weirdo who wa in a position where his dad told me i could just live with him work my job and spend free time working on my passion which wa writing soundtrack music in an instant my whole world the only person who ever mattered wa ripped away from me the tiny life insurance dried up in a year after settling the estate and his debt and the funeral and i 'm sitting here in my office right now just about ready to scream uncontrollably there are so many bill so so many bill and my job can barely cover them my fiancee ha been out of work for two year due to an injury and i 'm supporting both of u while trying to maintain the house with no friend or other family to speak of and it 's a battle i 'm slowly losing every day i do n't have any time for myself any more i do n't have time to exercise do n't have time to clean do n't have time to make music do n't have time to go back to school to get another degree that hopefully pay better than the first because i 'm just at the end of my rope and above all else i miss my dad every single day the one saving grace is that i also inherited his retirement account which ironically he wa never able to even touch and now i ca n't touch it until i 'm either and i do n't think i 'll make it that far i honestly worry about being homeless about having my whole life wasted because i 'm so alone with this burden of a room filling with water and i can only take out one tiny bucket at a time and i feel locked within my own body and totally unable to do anything some day i go to sleep and honestly hope i never wake up i hate this i hate everything i hate myself and this whole situation and all the people who were so mean to me my whole life only to end up in a happy place with my dad and then to have him taken away with no warning no explanation and no way to stop every day of my life i want to cry to breathe to take a break from all this stress and sadness and yet i have to get up and drag myself to this office because otherwise my fiancee and i will not be able to survive i need a break from all of this but i ca n't because my entire existence is tied to me working and trying to keep my head above water i do n't know what to do edit hey everybody i just wanted to say thank you for all your insight and thoughtful word i ended up going to bed yesterday after a bit of dialogue on this topic and had absolutely no idea this topic would explode the way it ha i 'm going to try to reply to a many people a possible but honestly feel a bit overwhelmed in a positive way of course i 've never had so many people actually caring about me just please know that i 've read everything you 've posted and if i do n't get back to you immediately i genuinely appreciate all of your thought and kindness,1

grew up in rural eastern montana every farmer i know spends a third of their life sitting up at 3am anxiously worrying that that storm is going to miss them and not get rain during that critical timing for their wheat than another 3rd is spent sitting up at 3am in the morning anxiously hoping and praying that that hail storm doesnt come through your crop and destroy everything a week before harvest than harvest come and it sitting in the combining all day and all night until you cant go any longer or something break than the final 3rd is winter you spend that fixing all the shit that broke during planting and harvest season so you can do it all again next summer what im saying is you basically spend a majority of your life worrying about something literally nobody control lol,0

what a fucking catch that is oh you need to foster positive relationship in your life but to do that you need social skill which i do n't have which make me hate my existence which make me cripplingly depressed which make everything seem pointless so then i try to improve my social skill but it go against fucking everything in my nature to actually be social i fucking hate everything about it from having to fucking manage my facial expression because they did n't fucking develop for whatever fucking reason and then having to fix every other basic facet of my personality just to get along with other people and the only other fucking alternative is to die cold and alone without anyone i ca n't make myself feel fucking happy on command i can not find something to legitimately smile about on command and honestly just having to fucking do that alone is enough for me to want to kill myself what the fuck is wrong with my brain that i literally can not make myself feel happy about anything i have no happy memory to go to i ca n't think of funny thing in my own fucking head i ca n't make myself laugh i do n't feel happy when i think about cute or innocent thing like puppy or smiling child i do n't feel happy when i think about my friend or family so what the fuck am i supposed to do accept that my brain is horribly sick for whatever fucking reason and fill my fucking head with pharmaceutical and i 'm supposed to be happy because of it and also manage my shitty life around actual clinical fucking treatment when i have no resource i swear fucking god man the anger that swell form this existence is unbearable i do n't want to surrender to life i do n't want to be happy anymore ca n't anyone see that it is impossible now i can not affect my mood for the better everything ha slowly but surely gone to shit everything unwittingly wittingly and everything in between fucking everything i do n't give a shit what happens to me anymore because how the fuck am i supposed to be happy about being alive and then afterwards there is the great nothing what the fuck god damn it i just want to fucking destroy but there is nothing to destroy what the fuck man there is nothing to set the hurricane of my rage ablaze to that would not result in self destruction or the destruction of the possession of others god damn this material world for all it 's worth which from my subjective point of view is absolutely nothing just like me because i never grew up to have value had to live with it nobody teaching me and now that i 'm all grown up i guess it 's up to me to find where i can bring value but i do n't care anymore what 's the value for for me for others what 's the fucking point man what 's the fucking point anymore i 'm stuck in this fucking paradoxical existence caught in frustration between love and hate and i hate both of those thing i want everything to be neutralized i want i want i want ahh stop cry you big fucking baby god damn it god damn it there is nothing anyone else can do either some people would agree with me that death in my only solace some people would just sadly accept it some people would insist i can still be happy people are all over the spectrum i guess i care too much about what they think but then again what the fuck else is there to turn to and live by besides the idea of other people i do n't have any substance to myself anymore i ca n't look to myself for a reason to care anymore i have no original thought or idea on how to be i have zero confidence i have zero hope i just want to self destruct but that will only bring more pain you ca n't expect anyone to tolerate the fact that your constantly in emotional distress either god damn this existence so fucking much i wish there wa something to destroy but there is nothing there is nothing to put an end to but my own shitty personality which i have been trying to do which ha been the most humiliating slow unfulfilling anxiety ridden process i have ever had to go through that technically i would say i have been going through forever but somehow i have to just come to grip with the fact that i did n't solve any of these issue of mine when i wa still a child with a developing brain not knowing what the problem were or what to do not being given any direction always being given reason to hate myself without it ever being explained what the fuck i wa doing wrong having to come to grip with the fact that oh i 'm an adult now and i 'm a failure at being a well balanced person for not being able to accept unchangeable fact about the course of my own life and all this sound to anyone is constant complaining which i guess it fucking is but god fucking damn it i am so god damn consumed by hate and hopelessness and emptiness that i just do n't care yes i am ashamed of myself of course i fucking am i fucking hate myself think of the person from history from your life whatever that you feel it is one hundred percent acceptable for you to completely despise for whatever reason this is how i feel about myself and i will never not hate who i am and who i have become no one understands my pain even if they do it doe not matter there is nothing anyone can do we are all alone in this world we are all alone or at least i am alone because of the way human nature work because i never grew up to live up to society 's expectation of what a person should naturally fucking be and i know how people in general treat outlier and deliquents if you are an outlier you are shunned and given no sympathy if you are a delinquent you are shunned and given no sympathy being an outlier could just mean not socially up to par people do n't fucking understand how taxing and unnatural it is for me to be able to have normal facial expression it 's just a non problem for most people so fuck me if my own naturally terrible social ability fuck me over in life and you know i had to fucking find out on my own about that stupid shit not once wa i given an opportunity to change until i found it myself maybe being angry about that in particular make me an entitled little bitch i do n't care man i just do n't care anymore i relate to negan on the walking dead man life ha utterly defeated me i do n't care anymore now a day i just do n't give a shit the pain is always there but what the fuck else am i going to do but ignore it with distraction,1

i broke up with my really toxic alcoholic boyfriend the day before he finally got accepted into a long term treatment program i told him that i would of course remain friend with him because i genuinely want to see him get better but i just do n't have the emotional capacity to deal with him fully anymore i ran out of my med a few week back and my primary care doctor refuse to give me a referral to a psychiatrist and im trying so hard to stay out of the dark spot but it 's getting really difficult im turning to my caffeine addiction again and i can tell im slowly starting to go downhill and i just got reprimanded at my new job for not doing something that i wa never told to do during training and i just started bawling ive been cry for like minute now and im just thankful no customer have walked in thursday is my year anniversary of my first psychotic break and my first breakup and hospitalization so in general it 's just a really rough week im just really completely and utterly exhausted and i wish i could make my brain shut up to give myself a little peace ive spent the last month faking it to make it and im finally just crumbling i know this is probably temporary but shit these bad day scare me so much,1

le people care what you do than you think i recently finished a presentation workshop with some colleague to improve our skill it wa a really enjoyable time and safe zone for critique the one epiphany i had by the end of it is how little many of u care when someone mess up we all have insecurity or thing going on daily that whatever mistake we do will occupy second of people s memory if you think an embarrassing gaffe is bad remember that it mean nothing to those involved with how much is already occupying their life i wa extremely nervous going into surgery earlier this year but when it wa over i never took the time to think about it recently i wanted to make a mental list of thing to be proud of myself for and looking back i am proud that i stayed calm and in control tl dr don t brush over the big or small accomplishment done every day remember people don t really care about your gaffe like you think what are some proud moment of your day,0

here we go again ok so i ve been depressed for so long my depression came back after only like month at uni and it all went downhill my gender issue cropped up again questioning if i wa transgender it s hard enough dealing with depression while at uni let alone thinking you might be trans and having to transition anyway i jumped off a bridge march and have been in hospital ever since i m still so depressed and now i m extra depressed about my injury i m still able to walk and hopefully my bladder and bowel will get back to normal it s horrible i feel so trapped i feel like there s nothing to leave hospital for and i dread being in the outside world so much i actually can t stand being seen and it s been a constant problem for me now every time i wake up i m reminded of my attempt and also the uncertainty of whether my bowel and bladder will get back to normal is eating away at me im so depressed i feel like damaging my chance of physical recovery my time in this hospital is nearly over i have nothing to recover for everything is so painful i wa sure i would die and wouldn t survive and so i neglected everything everything is getting to me now trienfships i ve neglected the fact i cant go back to uni this year i didn t even want to the urge to die is overwhelming loneliness is killing me even though i have people that could maybe visit i can t face them i honestly either want to die or just nap all day and not face my issue i m so so tempted to end it i can t keep on like this me surviving ha changed nothing about my outlook and i m just a pessimistic a ever i still feel like my situation is terrible and now i have the added stress of physical recovery i m so alone i have no motivation and i can t keep pretending i can stay in hospital forever but i feel it s either kill my self in here or a soon a i m out all i can think about is ending my life and now thing are getting so bad i feel like i need to i miss my friend but i can t reach out to them because i wan na die every day i wake up and just count down the hour until i can kill myself i don t want to ever be in the outside world again or basically start anything again i ve given up hope but i stay here and idk why,1

music is the only thing that make sense in this crazy world i m constantly listening to music it s like music is this omniscient entity or whatever the fuck that just understands wrap it s arm around you through every emotion when i think of suicide it s something i plan to do but then i think about the music and my stomach sink there are so many theory belief so many people claiming they know what happens people say nothing happens and others say something happens whatever this world is a prison either way and i want off i m at the point i don t know what the fuck happens after we pas i just hope that whatever the hell happens there s hella good music i love music,1
i don t think about my future enough to worry about anything i m just sad a fuck all the time even when i m happy i m still sad i can t explain it at least i don t have anxiety i guess,1
i think a lot of my depression is contributed to this shitty education system it doesn t reward being your own individual self with your own talent doesn t reward creativity and innovation it s too old fashioned in the past being good at following order wa what will get you through life so that you can become a factory worker but nowadays being good at just following order will get you nowhere being told what to do doing it in only one correct way every single week day a week it doe shit to your brain really it s a system meant for robot not human being and the importance on grade guess what if you don t reach this certain number your a worthless piece of trash that will never amount to anything it s so fucking stupid no wonder depression is at it peak in this century,1
seven up this wa my choice too so fascinating heartwarming and tragic all at the same time my big takeaway from the series wa that people who seem to know what their interest are at age seven and pursue those interest later in life tend to be quite content also that growing up poor can lead to all kind of problem later in life sadly,0
i wa quite shocked at their reaction i sorta expected a very stigmatized reaction for some reason the first professor blew up on me in immediate concern for my well-being he too had actually been through similar circumstance when he wa younger and the second professor he had a close friend who wa suicidal and very depressed a well he wa very calm throughout the whole conversation actually that wa a really fucking cool thing to have a legit chat about mental health with college professor edit i really ca n't express enough how reassuring all of your supportive comment are i would like everyone to know that i actually just recently started therapy for the first time this semester and it is doing wonder hopefully i get the courage to schedule with the on campus psychiatrist soon to see if medication can help also thank you all for reminding me that people do care about others thank you greatly,1

i doubt anyone will acknowledge this post but whatever i 've never truly lived life i 've been wasting away for a long a i 've been alive i 've isolated myself from basically everyone besides my family i barely even socialize online anymore every day is the fucking same either i 'm hopelessly depressed or slightly le depressed and foolishly thinking thing can get better but if someone else could see my whole life they would laugh at that thought everyone know me a being quiet but say i 'm nice and a good kid but i 'm sure they actually think i 'm a fucking retarded nobody i 'll never change no matter what i do because it 's in my nature to be the way i am i 'm doomed to be an antisocial loner for the rest of my life i want to stop existing but i do n't want to kill myself what i 'd give to just go to sleep and never wake up again pathetic to be sure edit i just want to express my thanks to everyone in this thread i really did n't expect much posting this thinking it would be like just another cry for help that would go unheard the overall response it received is honestly overwhelming to me i truly appreciate all the view upvotes and reply from people who cared enough to take the time to do so and to everyone who is in a similar situation to mine i hope we all get through this,1
no i 'm not staying in bed until 3pm because i think it 's cool funny or that i 'm lazy it 's because i ca n't bring myself to get up i 'm not wasting my life away on purpose or by choice this is n't how i want thing to be,1

unless you sent your tab to a lab there 's no way you can know if it wa 220ug or not tab are almost always over-promised for their dosage if it wa a advertised you 'd have had more than light geometry and waving assuming you were n't on any medication at the time it 's very much about what kind of attitude you bring to it you can just use it to party but that 's not where the life changing part come from that come from introspection and self-exploration from having your horizon broadened more than you ever thought possible maybe it 's just more impactful on people who are oriented to be more spiritual or who have rigid view i know before my first time i wa very critical of others view and wrote off anyone who disagreed with me a a moron but during that experience i saw myself from a third person pov from a million angle and i realized that my version of the world is only one bit of it that perception is reality within reason and that just because i do n't understand someone else 's view it doe n't mean they have n't thought about them that wa the opening of the door for me psychedelics have impacted me profoundly they do n't always have that effect on people and they are n't always positive when they do but my best guess is that your tab were underdosed and your setting wa not conducive to that kind of experience i just do n't think it 's fair to write off the whole rap just because you did n't have a transcendent experience though,0

anyone else feel like it 's not even the anxiety isolation lack of interest etc that feel the worst it 's the sense that nothing sufficiently bad ha happened to you to make you feel like you earned being depressed i remember at one of my lowest point a few year ago not wanting to call the hotline because i thought they would tell me it wa reserved for people with real problem of which i had none i just feel absolutely awful wasting away all of the time energy and money my family poured into me over the year when i feel depressed when i ca n't point to anything specific that 's causing it make me feel weak like i should just be able to snap out of it and when i do n't the guilt multiplies how bad i feel,1

i find it pleasurable when i feel pain and i do not know why i am no sadist or sadomasochist but i have known for a few year now that when i feel pain like the pain that you get from a run or even just an emotional pain i feel more like myself and i feel more at peace and pleasurable and able to focus more it is a if when i am not in pain or at least by just a little i do not feel like myself or at least able to do something it is a if i need to feel pain or sorrow of some kind without turning into some sort of pathology in order for me to do something or feel motivated to do something i tried to research this for year but never really managed to find a condition that explains it it feel weird that in a world where we do not want pain or want to avoid pain a much a possible and yet when i feel pain i feel more like myself,0

do i ask for too much i 'm sitting here typing this a i avoid bathing myself before going to work looking at calling in ever since i wa a child now i can remember how much pressure wa put on me to succeed i 'm above average intellect and have always excelled through schooling barring motivation issue i 've reached a point where my existence is altogether meaningless i used to have some faith or belief in god which always got me through lately i 've admitted to myself that i wa forcing belief because reality is so much more difficult to face i do n't see any meaning to life i am just a tiny random clump of cell in an ever expanding world this leaf me in a position where i deeply contemplate suicide i do n't know if it is just a mental bubble i 've created but i certainly have an overqualification mentality i learn rather quickly and so in my attempt at uni i have become extremely disgruntled and can not get myself to attend class i show up and learn minute worth of material over the course of an hour and can not handle having so much wasted time in my life i am not getting younger and my early 20 are being stolen by school and work the field which i 've pursued in school have not been true passion of mine the only thing at this point in my life i can seriously consider a meaningful is playing music when i reach this point i start feeling suicidal i 've always played music started begging for piano lesson at age and i consider myself to be talented but what make me deserve to make a living doing something i love i would lead a happy life if i could just be left to practice and enjoy myself i just feel so greedy for wanting that i know that there are million of other people like me who would want to make music for a living and i do n't feel a though i deserve that kind of success i 'm not chasing fame and fortune i 'm chasing a more enjoyable way to afford a roof and a bed my heart and mind are not invested in a life producing for the messy materialism driven society we have around u lately a i weigh my option and the actual purpose of me being on this earth suicide becomes a much more appealing option a simple solution to the suffering that i am feeling i have no belief that there is any sort of afterlife and so it feel a though i have nothing to lose i 'll be too dead to worry about losing my life i did n't ask to be born and now i 'm suddenly the one who ha to be responsible for that i did n't ask to be born everything would leave me to believe that these feeling are invalid and that i am asking for too much out of life,1
i am not coping ca n't get up and go to work started picking place to die it 's almost 9am and i 'm supposed to be at work but i 'm in bed i have n't had a good day since i found out my best friend from university got accepted on to a prestigious free master programme since we both graduated together in fine art she 's won a 20k fellowship i came third in the same student prize winning that is all gone now she 's also been granted 20k in government funding and she 's done an alternative master for a year on the other hand i have lived in different place in two year wa traumatised by my mother age-gap husband trying to come on to me ended up in an abusive relationship that only ended when i ran away in the night spent month severely depressed and unable to find work suffered a mental breakdown and had to move back in with my mother i now work at a gas company doing entry level admin i am year old recently i went to see a mental health nurse and she told me that i am not able to regulate my emotion because my parent never showed me how i do n't feel any hope that i can learn i feel like i had no hope from the beginning i feel like my blood is doomed i sometimes wonder if i am fundamentally unable to experience happiness it seems like my whole life i have had a void inside me and nothing will fill it at all the only thing that ha ever come close is when i wa making art and getting recognition for it now to see my friend live my dream while i have to live with the consequence of my inability to make decent decision or any progress a an individual is intolerably painful there is something seriously wrong with me i believe myself to be broken beyond repair i look around at the wreckage of my life and i feel no desire to try to repair it i have no interest in battling so hard from here just to have to settle for the shredded scrap of life i 'm capable of salvaging they are n't worth it to me i know i will never be able to be content with that meaningless slog existence merely surviving the opportunity i had to work hard have passed me by and so i do n't see that i have a future worth living for i am a woman and i find nothing more laughable and pathetic than the idea of an aging female delusional artist thinking she ha something worth sharing that is so embarrassing to me i feel i have no choice but to kill myself i have looked up article to try to find reason to live many say that the future is an unknown and that we create our own destiny i know that my destiny can only go a far a my ability i am not talented or personable enough to create the life i truly want i 'm unable to accept le where doe that leave me i 've been researching the best place to go to die i already know that the best way will be walking out into the sea i do n't think i will pick anywhere meaningful i started scrolling around my map app to see if any coastal town name appealed to me i wish i did n't have to worry about my parent i wish they understood that to force me to live out my day in constant disappointment and pain is n't kind,1

anyone else find that their earphones/headphones have become a permanent part of them i realised this while i wa working on an assignment on my laptop i 'd had my earphone in my ear for the last hour but had n't listened to any music they were just there i often have them on at school a well because standing around awkwardly or sitting in silence staring at the wall is frowned upon i find it hard having conversation with others so instead of looking like a weird lonely person who just stare into the distance looking at nothing i put in my earphone and listen to music sometimes i do n't even play music but i 'll keep them in i have my earphone in right now but nothing is playing because i 'm busy with an assignment but i still do not want to take my earphone off listening to music is also one of the only time during the day when i really feel positive emotion there 's not much to be happy about in my life or i find it hard being happy so music provides me with a rush of all these amazing emotion it feed me soul lol i do n't know i guess music is my only friend,0

suicidal thought i do n't believe this is wrong hey guy i have a lot of physical and mental problem i hope to see a therapist soon i have made mistake really bad mistake i 'm year old and i feel like an old man i am agnostic i feel that death is not a bad thing it is quite interesting perhaps something good will happen maybe nothing maybe i will be in peace recently i 've been contemplating suicide but not so much it 's kinda like a last resort if anything go really wrong is this wrong am i noble for being optimistic about death i have considered the pro and con the benefit is that i wo n't hurt anyone anymore directly and i wo n't hurt myself by not existing but on the flip side my parent and sibling will be heart broken i am generally happy but sometimes these mistake i make i ca n't tell anyone it 's not like i killed anyone or ever physically hurt someone i consider myself to be a really kind and good person many people say the same but i have no friend and society generally see me a a problem im all alone constantly dealing with anxiety for the past year there ha n't been one day that i have n't been anxious i have been trying hard to stay optimistic this whole time but in the end i just secluded myself being a shut in any thought on my view on suicide is it okay if thing go really really wrong the probability that such a terrible event may occur is hopefully only but there is still a chance and a chance of something bad happening mean that i need a plan a backup plan i 'm afraid of pain my physical condition ha made me want to stay away from any pain is there even a painless way to die,1
i highly doubt it 'll get much better i 've had semi-frequent suicidal thought since my sophomore year of high school and a a college freshman i do n't see how the whole life get better thing work i 'd say that in my life so far most year are worse than the previous elementary school wa ok middle school wa the only outlier in that i enjoyed it for some reason the first half of high school wa not great the second half wa bad and now college is the worst i am getting terrible grade and feel consistent stress i know the freshman year of college is supposed to be the easiest workload-wise so i 'm sure life will get worse when i am pulling more all-nighters than the almost weekly one i have to pull this year after college i 'll have to leave my friend yet again to work for a company that doe n't care for me and have adult responsibility i 'll have to worry about money way more frequent stressful social interaction constant monotony keeping my job one of my high school teacher confirmed that life doe n't get better when she mentioned that she wish she could be in our place when my friend and i were complaining i also just experienced my first breakup a month ago i wa with him for year i imagined living my life with him experienced so many first with him i will probably find someone else but i will probably fall out of love with them too they 'll cheat on me once i 'm no longer attractive it happens to plenty of people love is n't worth living for the future is n't worth living for what 's the point in staying alive then the good day have never and will never outweigh the bad one,1

sitting here the darkness fold on on me the evil in my mind ebb and flow like a pulse that sadness that 's not sadness radiates i 'm angry i have to work soon put on a mask of fake i hate myself so much i tremble what the fuck am i doing i wish my instinct to persevere wa n't so strong just walk into my bathroom and hang myself done no more pain nothing fucking matter but no part of me scratch and bite and kick refusing to go i 've been at this moment to many time draining my energy wishing i could turn the brain off permanently but my other self wo n't let me instead time get to chip away at me,1
i m dreaming about killing my self i don t know why there s no reason for me to be suicidal right now the only problem in my life are of my own creation i put off my work and procrastinated and missed a few deadline and let some people down but no one is mad at me no is disappointed and saying that i did anything terribly wrong i m upset with myself on a cognitive level but i don t feel upset with myself i don t feel anything actually i just feel numb and i can t do anything anything that requires more movement than my thumb settling up this account seemed like much i google how to kill myself and think about it how i want my lifeless body to be found and for my problem to all disappear i wish i could just fall asleep and never wake up my head feel cloudy and foggy and i just want to sleep and when i finally do i wake up feeling more tired than ever i feel like i don t belong anywhere that my current life is meaningless that i just want to move on and that death would be the easiest way forward i think it s stupid but also it just seems to make perfect sense i don t know what to do i want to talk to someone about this but i don t have anyone like i said i don t belong anywhere or to anyone all i had wa the responsibility and obligation that i made and now that i can t maintain those i have no more value and no more meaning no one calling me and asking about me they want to know why i can t provide what i said i would if i m gone that s all they ll care about the service i could ve provided me i ve no inherent value i feel so tired thinking about this the struggle to be needed and wanted and cared for i worked so hard and i got nothing and now i can t try anymore and i still have nothing so where else am i supposed to go i have money and comfort and safety and the basic need are taken care of but it s all so empty and meaningless i ve tried buying thing that i thought would make me feel some kind of joy but it hasn t helped and now i feel like enough is enough and i just want it all to be over i want to wake up with some sort of desire or hope or i don t want to wake up at all if there s anyone out there i just want to know that these word can be seen,1
if not for my family i would be dead honestly the only thing stopping me from killing myself is my family i know how it would crush them my mom probably wouldn t make it through it would hurt her so much and she s been through enough i don t want to fuck up my sister any more than the world already ha i don t want to create that pain and emptiness in the heart of my aunt and uncle i don t want my grandma and grandpa to live long enough to have their grandchild die like that they are the only reason if they were all to just forget i existed or disappear i would be jumping of a building by now or something so i guess i m not suicidal because i know i couldn t do it but that s the only reason i have my ended my life i couldn t be so selfish a to leave them with so much pain,1

frustrated and hating myself hi all writing this is super difficult for be because i 've been through depression and spate of wanting to commit suicide myself but in the end this is n't about me it 's about my girlfriend starting off i 'll give a bit of context and backstory to the situation we started dating a year ago and while she had depression then she wa high functioning and her risk assessment wa very low i have training in risk assessment and prevention however after a while she had to move a good distance away for post-secondary it wa around this time she started to degrade i made it a point to visit her a often a i could about once a week for a weekend a my job allowed it i recently lost my job and moved down to be with her initially i hoped that that would help her but it seemed to have to opposite effect recently i got a new job and have been working longer hour tonight i came home to her in the worst of her episode to date she shut me out of our room and broke down i 've been trying to get her to agree to go see a professional but she insists that doing so give her depression power and that she want to die her risk assessment wa vastly worse that when i had previously done it and to be honest i 'm running out of idea my biggest fear is coming home to find that she 's hurt herself or worse i need help,1

this is gon na be long i 'm turning soon there ha n't been a day in the past year in which i did n't think about killing myself i 've been a depressed teenager for a long a i can remember but shit got really hard when my first and only real girlfriend broke up with me she seemed to be the only thing to give light to the world and i 'm not even being poetical when i wa with her i felt i had purpose that i could pursue whatever goal i set however i wa childish and inexperienced and the relationship only last a year and half it 's been five year now i 've had other people in my life but i do n't really feel like i 'm alive at all every day i think about her every day i think about how useless i am and how dumb i wa for screwing everything up it 's such a recurring and invasive thought that it impairs everything i do i could n't finish any type of college course or higher education i ca n't get a job i ca n't see a purpose in it yes i 'm living with my mother and she support me in all this but it 's a pain to know that i 'm a burden however i do n't see a point in pursuing anything my psychiatrist diagnosed me early on with cyclotomic bipolar disorder depression i 've tried to kill myself time already and been twice put in a mental institution for a week or so the most recent in october of the last year stuffed myself with all prescription medication in the house and lot of alcohol stabbed my leg with a pocket knife spent day in the hospital you know before that last attempt i wa always getting in and out of depressing state they were more or le intense i 've done a lot of drug and alcohol in the last five year everyday thinking about my ex girlfriend and about killing myself but then after being so close to death after losing a lot of blood from the wound in the leg and after realising how fragile i am and how somewhat easy would be to attempt it again something changed inside of me the fear wa kind of fading you know but i 've been trying to get better on the surface i really do want to die you see but i guess we all have some sort of instinctive block that prevents u from hurting ourselves life ha no meaning for me without her and i know in general that life ha no meaning i have nothing to seek after i have no will to go after a job or go outside and talk to people i 'm the guy stuck in the bedroom playing world of warcraft and stuff everyday the urge to just cease existing get a tiny little bit bigger and the overall emptiness and realization of how easy it would be get more and more room in me i do drink a lot yes i know it only worsens the depression but if i 'm not drunk i get those fierce intrusive thought reminding me of how useless and lonely i am of how i could n't do right for the only person who looked at me with love and understanding might seem exaggerated but it is really hard it 's like a whole text of bad thing being said to me by me in a fraction of second every fucking second that might be what they call anxiety i ca n't keep up with it anymore it 's soulcrushing a fuck i 've been trying to stay afloat the last few month doing exercise regularly trying to focus on what i enjoy doing drawing pretending i could be an artist someday trying to stay active in social interaction fake till you make it right but i just ca n't keep at it anymore since last friday i 've been spiraling down again into apathy and self loathing who do i think i 'm fooling i live with my mother and my sister my sister is the only person for which i worry in case of my suicide i would n't want to scar her for life since we are very close but that doe n't seem to be a strong enough reason for me to stay alive i would n't be here enduring her suffering nor mine after all and i 'm filled with suffering already i 'm planning to end it soon but i do n't feel confident about it either there is a part from anne 's rice novel the vampire lestat in which a character is in insufferable pain from tuberculosis and stay put in such a position that increase that pain to it limit so that she could gather the strength to accept death without second thought that 's my mindset thank you if you read all this i just had to vent everybody else is already sick of my shit,1

my life story for my whole life i 've been incredibly lonely no one would ever invite me to do any activity it did n't help that i used to live in the middle of nowhere so it wa difficult to make friend even during elementary school nobody would want to even talk to me the ugly kid it took my 2nd grade teacher to literally ask the class who wanted to be my friend and no one raised their hand except for like person from that day i thought he wa my friend but once middle school came around he started to hang out with other people and i wa alone again the people he would sit with at lunch did n't bother to make any room so i usually sat at the table next to them alone a usual but over time i started to have people talk to me and it wa pretty good i mean i wa still lonely but it is n't like i wa left in the dust but some people did talk to me i moved at the beginning of the second half of 7th grade and i went to a new middle school where i wa lonely once again for a little while the usual new kid situation and then one day i started to get talked to and started to make friend and even got a girlfriend but shit changed after she dumped me suddenly no one wanted to interact with me and the people who were my friend did n't want me around them anymore now i wa the loneliest kid in the entire school and everyone began to bully me i started to get even more depressed to the point where someone reported me to the counselor and there wa this massive conversation where they were trying to make me confess that i wa suicidal now i wa but i did n't want them to get involved and thought i could solve shit myself but the loneliness kept going until the end of the year apparently i failed 7th grade and i wa absolutely devistated i tried my best to get my grade up but no matter what i did nothing happened the teacher would say that they would help but they never did i should also bring up that my friend from my old school never talked to me no text nothing fastfoward to 8th grade i wa put into a renaissance school to help get me ready for 8th grade they moved me up so that wa more possible or something i do n't remember and that wa it during the year i made some friend at least people that would give me the answer to stuff that i needed help on so that wa fine i still did n't really talk at all and some people still made fun of me but it wa n't a extreme like 7th grade but after awhile i started to report somebody for being an absolute cunt to me for no reason there wa this one incident on the bus where i asked her how would she felt if i killed myself and she just laughed at my face but when i reported her and after signing a contract basically a do n't come near me form and i began to describe what happened that day on the bus and he asked if i ever had suicidal thought and i said yes just to make thing shorter i got a school therapist to help me and you know what she did help until i went back to the middle school suddenly everything she helped me with came back to me and her word did n't matter somehow though i got another girlfriend and just like the last relationship it ended i should mention that the last two relationship lasted for like a fucking week so it did n't help that it wa that long and made thing worse when it wa either on or the day after valentine 's day so i 'm completely devistated again until i go onto high school i forgot to mention that the reason why i moved wa because my parent split so my dad moved to one place and i moved with my mom but after 8th grade i went with my dad in hope to start over again i had a great time during 9th grade and the first half of 10th grade like for the first time i finally had friend and people to joke with at home i wa alone and inside but at school i wa talkative and had people to talk to but at the same time i started to have a friendship with my 8th grade ex gf after awhile we became close and i trusted her with my issue and she would talk to me i started to have feeling for her again because of how close i wa with her i thought i wa the only one that went through the same issue but she wa there for me it started again after 8th grade during the summer and i loved her so much for being there for me and i wanted to go back for her since she wa starting to become my best friend something i 've always wanted in my life but at the beginning of the 2nd half of 9th grade i started talking to an 8th grader who i also wanted to see badly because i wa starting to like her a well since she wa coming to high school next year i decided to stay at the school to see her here come 10th grade where she wa finally at the school and i could see her thing did n't go well after awhile she did n't talk to me at all nor wan na acknowledge me she would talk to her friend but it wa me that she did n't want to really interact with at this point it would 've been year since i had a girlfriend and why that is something i 'd bring up is because i felt pressured to have a girlfriend everyone wa constantly posting about omg look at how amazing my babe is and i wanted something like that but it felt like everyone wa taken or had a specific preference i wa n't anyone 's preference the people i liked would never talk to me and if they did it wa only for like a week and that 's it i wanted someone to tell me that they loved me but it never happened after awhile shit fell apart between me and that one girl because she did n't seem at all interested in even talking to me so after that i decided to leave and go back living with my mom it wa n't just me wanting to be closer to the person i hold dear to me but it wa also because my dad wa being a complete asshole with the way i 'd miss school somedays he would lose it if i even miss one day of school and it did n't help that even if i wa sick it wa freezing cold or the bike i use to ride to the bus wa fucked up somehow if i even missed minute he 'd lose it so i wa under a lot of stress because of him i went back with my mom just so i could be close to my now best friend i had to leave a lot of my friend for her but to me it felt worth it it wa an up and down relationship but i still felt extremely close to her and even shared some of my personal issue with her but she 's changed since 8th grade she 's now more talkative and wa out there with certain thing i did n't mind at all since i wa her friend but the problem came when she did n't really talk to me during school and only exclusively talked to me outside through text or when i 'm at her house she considered me her brother because of how close we were and i considered her my sister even though deep down i loved her but the fact that she did n't talk to me during school and treated me like shit became a problem i had and every once in awhile i would lash out at her because of my problem everytime it did happen she would call off the friendship but the next day i 'd be quick to apologize for my stupidity this ongoing cycle of me and her being friend then an issue come up/reappeared argument then apology happened over and over again until today she finally said that she wa done with me and my bullshit i 'm sorry for the long read but i wanted to tell you guy what led me to this point in my life i 'm a failure lost cause ugly pathetic outcast with no friend no money nothing redeeming about me i 've tried so much but nothing ever work out i 'm like close to ending my life right now i 'm a burden to everyone i 've ever known and no one want anything to do with me everyone i talk to go away in after awhile and it doe n't help that it 's usually me that cause it to happen i just ca n't handle anything anymore and i 'm sorry but i 've tried everything i could to make shit work out but eventually nothing worked out i 'm done and i can not handle the fucking loneliness anymore if anyone actually read through this whole thing then i commend you goodbye,1

it turn intelligent kind people into zombie who can t wash a dish or change their sock it affect the ability to think clearly to feel anything to ascribe value to your lifelong passion your relative good fortune it scoop out your normal healthy ability to cope with bad day and bad news and replaces it with an unrecognizable sludge that find no pleasure no delight no point in anything you alienate your friend because you can t comfort yourself socially you risk your job because you can t concentrate you live in moderate squalor because you have no energy to stand up let alone take out the garbage you become pathetic and you know it and you have no capacity to stop the downward plunge you have no perspective no emotional reserve no faith that it will get better so you feel guilty and ashamed of your inability to deal with life like a regular human which exacerbates the depression and the isolation if you ve never been depressed thank your lucky star and back off the folk who take a pill so they can make eye contact with the grocery store cashier no one on earth would choose the nightmare of depression over an averagely turbulent normal life it s not an incapacity to cope with day to day living in the modern world it s an incapacity to function at all no one chooses it no one deserves it it run in family it ruin family you can not imagine what it take to feign normalcy to show up to work to make a doctor appointment to pay bill to walk your dog to return library book on time to keep enough toilet paper on hand when you are exerting most of your capacity on trying not to kill yourself depression is real compassion is also real and a depressed person may cling desperately to it until they are out of the wood and they may remember your compassion for the rest of their life a a force greater than their depression have a heart,1

going to agree with this there is of u and our parent are career sailor my three older sister are nicknamed the den mother and my self the godfather one or both parent were always out to sea so we took care of the younger sibling then after they retired while i wa still in high school and my sister were in college they would get mad that no one came to them for advice a ride or help with homework like for example i always had my older sister sign my permission slip or ask for a ride home from practice they didnt understand that we just relied on each other not that they didnt want to help but they had to work so we basically became a successful version of shameless since they retired we have all gotten closer with mom and dad but it wa awkward the first couple of year sorry for the rant,0

i m only halfway through reaching and at this point in my life i ve lost all interest i give up on life i m done with everything i wake up trying to be positive because i have people i look forward to meeting but to know that no matter how optimistic i am i m still gon na get neglected ha made me numb over time i tell myself i need my personal space and it ll help but people misunderstand and they move away a they think i am intentionally moving away but i don t have suicidal thought or idea of self harm however i do tell myself if i wa to die it ll probably be more peaceful i d leave people burden free heck i even tell myself there d be more oxygen because of one le life i know i have people who do care for me and they want to see me back home every day so i never took my life since it s also a sin in my religion though if i wa to die of other cause anytime soon i d be fine with that never saw a doctor or therapist because people with such thought are looked down on a people who can not help themselves and are abnormal in society i always put on a fake smile so no one know what i m going through because if i m not suicidal or edgy no one care i m just done with life and everything it ha to throw at me but i still have well over another year on average to bear with,1

life is way too much effort and too expensive i 'm tired of having to do all this shit just to maintain a half-decent life i 'm tired of having to feed myself to stave off hunger eating right so i do n't let myself get fat exercising to try to maintain my health and make sure my body doe n't break down even though if i 'm still alive by age chance are i 'll probably get cancer anyways i 'm tired of working an meaningless corporate job just to pay a bunch of bill and rent that take up of my monthly paycheck even before factoring bill for a sq ft apartment in a boring city whose only upside is the proximity to nyc which honestly is n't even that close still there is no end point in sight i 've lost every passion i 've had in life i do n't want to work i ca n't see anything that i would enjoy doing for at least hr of the week for the rest of my life at this point but i have no other choice if i do n't want to become homeless and starve the worst part of it is despite all this shit i have to do and upkeep i 'm not even enjoying life i do everything right i eat well i make decent money to at least be financially independent from my parent i exercise every day i have hobby i have a small handful of friend but i still find life meaningless and hopeless and such a pain in the as i ca n't shake my feeling of emptiness the small nugget of fleeting inconsistent happiness are not worth the daily annoying struggle that add up to a mountain over time i wish my parent had never had me or that some other sperm had won the race i feel guilty for feeling this way since my parent sacrificed so much for a kid who is depressed and just want to die lmao then again it wa n't my choice can t catch the bus either since i don t want to hurt their feeling and i m deathly afraid of failing and leaving myself permanently crippled if i m gon na be miserable i d rather be miserable and physically capable v miserable and maimed i feel like life is a stupid cycle of most job being meaningless and maybe tolerable if you 're lucky so people turn to other people/their relationship and friendship for happiness/meaning although to be honest people can be disappointing a well which can hurt way more than a bad day at work plus it 's shit hard to make friend the older you get and most of your friend are gon na drift away a they get married and have kid and then you 're stuck disappointed and alone again until you bring a kid into the world in a struggle to find meaning in this universe just for them to go through the same damn cycle and all this make me depressed in a cosmic way do n't mind the rant i 'm just having the monday feel at work i guess,1

this is going to sound very selfish but almost every day i wish i could die from an accident because i don t want to do the deed myself for example i took some over-the-counter medicine last night since i wa feeling really sick and i wa hoping it would give me an allergic reaction that would kill me over the summer i wa walking around my hometown late at night one of the most violent city in the u and hoped that i would get shot by someone this all sound really messed up even when i think about it because these scenario that i think of could potentially harm others involved in these fictional situation i ve never told anyone about this since i m afraid i will seem like a major asshole but can anyone relate to this,1

i wish i could give my life to someone who want to live sometimes i wish i could trade place with a terminal cancer patient who is holding onto life a tightly a he can i do not have any enthusiasm for life and it seems like a waste i feel like i am going through the motion just waiting to die and it 's going to be a long wait i have been in therapy for year and it 's constantly like this i wish euthanasia for mental illness were a thing see there is nothing in this world that brings me joy i do not have any hobby and i do not have a job i am going to be evicted if i do not find something before may and while i have been applying i also do n't see the point i have this black-and-white image in my head like a flipbook of me going through the motion until i am older enough to retire i think i would rather cut to the chase because being alive hurt there morning where i wake up and take a handful of sleeping pill to make myself fall asleep again that 's really what i am doing i am waiting to die it kind of feel good to type this out i have not been out of my apartment for almost two week it 's almost like i 've forgotten what the sound of my own voice sound like my boyfriend recently moved away and we hardly talk anymore my therapist dumped me it 's a long story it wa kinda my fault so dont blame her so i am without support or structure i do not have any friend my family think i am being a drama queen and wo n't play this game with me anymore if i were to kill myself tonight i wonder how long it would take the world to notice i imagine it would take a while unless my decomposing body start to smell and a neighbor complains i have prescription for a whole cocktail of drug but i am not certain that an overdose would be successful i 'm sure since i have stimulant and relaxant and sedative and with some alcohol i do n't drink so i image i do n't have a lot of tolerance it almost feel like i can pull it off my biggest fear is failing i am afraid i will only have a seizure and then have to deal with the aftermath of my suicide attempt god i do n't want to spend more time in a psych ward,1

i seriously do n't know where to start my horrible luck is something really wrong with me i lost another job and it barely even started i wa in training 13.50/hr call center job for what wa supposed to be week it wa day of my 2nd week of training today i wa early for every shift i wa always the first person to volunteer to try any example test given i wa one of only people out of trainee to even show up to work yesterday and of those i wa the only one consistently working on outgoing call while the other trainee gossiped for the majority of the time with the teacher they said if something wa ever wrong if we ever made a mistake we would be called in and spoken to and corrected i thought i wa doing well they told me i wa doing well a of yesterday this job wa supposed to solve my life there wa a chance all i can think to do now is sit here in tear and type to reddit this wa the first job in a long time where it seemed like long term employment this would have solved everything i told myself i would n't get my hope up too high this time but i did and now i 'm pretty broken x200b my mom just now came in and showed me this long bullshit speal my uncle did applying me to a job i would never have applied to it wa a full page of why i would be amazing for this position and i could n't bear to read any more than the first paragraph of sappy and untrue info he sent them including my incorrect age i just spent the past minute in a breakdown and all i can say is no more over and over again i tried going to the washroom and mom wa eavesdropping on me outside of my bedroom door so naturally the whole family is going to know x200b i have had similar problem with learning before at other job but all they told me at this one wa that i wa n't learning fast enough and it would be best for them to sever tie with me they said to all of u that what we learned so far wa of the info and that training would be between week it make no sense i do n't understand at every job something happens before this my last job i quit because law changed and the new law stated my job wa illegal before that work ran out with my own personal business before that it wa layoff before that the company went out of business/layoffs before that i wa harassed to the point of quitting because i wa having a hard time learning the job similar to this one before that wa a company closing my branch and laying off and before that wa the same company that had later re-hired me after a temp job x200b i will be this year i have never been able to keep a job move out or even attract a partner for more than a handful of first date i have never been fired from a job before this and i have never been able to keep one all i can think of is suicide i do n't understand how i can fail so much with every hope of success always turning to the worst kind of failure why why me i do n't understand i do n't know how i am going to deal with this debt i now owe i 've never been in the hole like this before my credit rating is impeccable not for long x200b p.s i 've been to get mental health care before but the best they did for me wa stick me with a student who cut me off every time i said anything that wa n't related to the main issue my memory when i eventually got passed off to a mental health clinician and i told him i thought this wa a waste of time i wa just told i did n't have to come back also they said they do n't keep record after month so that really wa a waste of my time,1
but then i get sad because i realize that i 'll never be that happy again,1
yes literally i kno we like to say we are lonely here but actually most people here actually have someone to talk to even if it 's online that being said i just havr to say that i am trying to deal with it and a embarrassing a it may sound i often talk to myself aloud just to hear someone speak even if i hate my voice and i find it grating i am mostly okay with it i think sometimes it get really bad but i try to occupy my mind with video game anf music so i do n't think about killing myself edit i want to thank everyone for replying to this i had no idea it would blow up so much i wa very in my feeling when i made this post and on the verge of actually killing myself i went to sleep and now i am feeling a little better i promise i will take time to read all the reply and respond to everyone i also want to thank everyone who sent me a private message i will reply to those too but at the moment i am just feeling overwhelmed cause i didint expect people to actually relate to this or reply i know it sound cheesy but i just wish i could hug all of you,1

most of this is very good advice allow me to add one caveat- with some drug the first time is the best by far dont bother to do 'just a tiny line or 'take just a puff do the drug dont overdo the drug or get antsy and double up because it isnt kicking in it will kick in relax let the chemical do their work introducing your body to new sensation changing the way you think about the world around you then realize that in a very real way every subsequent experience run the risk of chasing that first high eventually that lead to a regret familiar to a lot of u who are past our experimental year a lot of u have wasted a lot of time chasing drug long after they became a dead end there 's a point where you 're better off finding other thing to enjoy other path to realization and answer and peace dont limit yourself to chemi,0

designer clothes i wa talking to one of my friend earlier about clothes for a little bit her family ha more money than most of our friend group but she is super humble about it and not many people are even aware since she doe n't flaunt it however when she go shopping she doe tend to go for the big designer brand because she can afford it she always offer to pay for everything for everyone though because she understands that she is more fortunate financially than most of her friend and she doe n't like seeing people suffer money wise or in any other way i always try to refuse when she doe this just cause i 'm not a fan of people spending money on me i also joke and tell her that i always go straight for the clearance rack when i am out shopping which ins't really that much of a joke since i do honestly do that but it 's just fun to joke about with her she wa saying tonight that we should go shopping together for our athletic banquet in may and she said we wo n't go to the super expensive store even though she want to get me designer type clothes/items i told her that for the past three year i 've gone to tjmaxx and gotten my dress for the banquet there i personally have never been a fan of designer clothing all of the big name in woman 's fashion that i 'm even aware of because i know barely any name just do n't look cute to me whereas the more affordable stuff generally look better and fit nicer on me this could also stem from the fact that i just automatically put down anything that ha a big price tag a unappealing to me growing up my parent struggled to pay bill and i watched a my dad worked his as off to get every promotion possible to be able to get a bigger paycheck he even needed to get a second job for a while my brother really liked the nike air jordan sneaker and would buy them constantly to the point where my parent would yell at him about money me leading a life where my entire goal wa to avoid being yelled at saw this and determined that spending money wa a bad thing so i always saved not to mention the recession started when i wa about 10/11ish and i still think we 're in it even though i know we 're not these are just some of all the factor that have made me someone who watch my money a bit too closely designer brand are beyond luxury and i have no interest in ever getting them for myself also some girl made fun of me in high school for not knowing who tory burch wa and when i googled it later in the day i saw that those clothes were really ugly and expensive personally what 's the most expensive clothing item you 've ever bought for yourself can you name the designer for any of the clothes you own or do you not even bother looking at the tag how conservative/frugal are you with spending money on yourself do you know anybody who is well off financially but still a good person what 's a trait you developed because of how you saw your family act a you were raised ^^this ^^is ^^post ^^out ^^of ^^360something ^^with ^^my ^^goal ^^to ^^have ^^a ^^conversation ^^on ^^here ^^every ^^day ^^of ^^feel ^^free ^^to ^^comment ^^on ^^anything ^^i 've ^^said ^^answer ^^my ^^questions ^^or ^^just ^^talk ^^freely ^^about ^^yourself ^^even ^^if ^^it ^^does n't ^^relate ^^to ^^the ^^post ^^i 'm ^^here ^^to ^^chit ^^chat ^^it 's ^^been ^^days ^^since ^^i ^^last ^^missed ^^a post,0

i do n't know how to drive yet i 'm currently and i 've been struggling with not wanting to drive there are a lot of societal pressure and people in my life that make me feel like i should be making more of an effort to learn i currently have my permit but learning to drive is really low on my priority list i 'm lucky enough to have a supportive family and they are n't pressuring me at all however i feel like a burden because they always drive me to where i need to go this is solely my own feeling my family ha told me multiple time that it 's okay also i do n't feel independent in that aspect obviously so there are day where it take a toll on my self-esteem like i should be driving and taking responsibility for myself since i 'm an adult everyone around me classmate friend co-worker extended family etc know how to drive and tend to ask me why i have n't learned yet if i 'm not in a good mindset it tends to rub me the wrong way and i end up feeling insecure have any of you experienced the same feeling if so how did you come to accept it i do n't want to rush into driving and end up in a bad situation plus it 's really not something i feel like putting time and energy into right now how do i become more patient and not let the opinion of others affect what i want to do,0
a a disclaimer i am sure that i am by no mean special in this i am completely sure that someone if not everyone ha felt this way before with that where do i begin i guess i can start with the fact that over the last year or so i 've become almost completely emotionally stagnant all i ever seem to feel is frustration anger and a deep sadness but i can never or rarely act on these few emotion i always have this monotone facade that i wear on my face like a mask and no matter how hard i try i ca n't shake it this just deepens my sadness and frustration i feel trapped in my head spiraling down into madness and i 'm not really an antisocial person but i 've never really been good at communicating my thought and feeling to others leading to constant failure of relationship and on the same topic i have so many great idea that seems ingenious to me and strange experience but my poor ability to properly vocalize them lead to it being confusing or it risk sounding idiotic to others most of the time it seems there is a severe disconnect between my mind and body like a wall to the point which i try telling myself to do something but my body doe nothing or the complete opposite and it make me feel trapped in my head i 've gotten to the point where i 've almost completely shut everything out and it all seems pointless to me anymore only time i can keep my mind off of these thought is when i 'm working but due to prior experience relationship and failure i ca n't seem to commit to anything including job over the last two year back to the main point though i ca n't cry i 've tried so many thing i always tend to feel indifferent to thing an average person would feel emotion towards when some emotion doe hit me it random but i can never seem to express it i at least want my sadness back i want to cry if someone can please help sorry for the essay,1

only do it around good people or by yourself in case of freak out find a quiet place and meditate on nothing do everything you can to focus on nothing you will peel through layer of your mind inevitably but when it get to be too much just anchor yourself back onto thinking of nothing it can be an insanely fun drug in the right circumstance but for the most part it s a phycological cleanser if you have shit to deal with it s going to make you face it if you do it around the wrong people and in the wrong situation it can scar you permanently if you don t have an experienced friend to be sober and play shaman for you i suggest not doing it also some pot for the come down is really helpful,0

everything feel empty i want to get my story out there so maybe this community is a good place to start… i 'm a year old trans girl from brazil i 've been suffering through depression and anxiety since i wa a little kid i 've been told i wa a mistake and worthless by my parent countless time even a a child… i had problem in school but instead of solving any of them my parent just beat me and threw me in a public school where i wa beaten and bullied every day maybe the only friend i had back then wa my brother but we were distant in a sense since he ha asperger's… but we got along and watched cartoon together while our parent shouted to each others and shut door down around the house when i turned i wa finally back in a particular school a good one but i did n't really perform well in it a my depression wa already piling up on me even then… and all the matter and teaching system were way more superior than what i wa used to… so i wa basically performing extremely subpar… which obviously destroyed my self-esteem and i 'd feel like a worthless disappointment around also is when my gender dysphoria started to peak a a child… i 'd cry every night wanting to be a girl even if i did n't know why it happened… it just did… and it stung even more that at school the girl would n't really even try to socialize with me… everyone deemed me gross and hideous year old came by and i wa still in the same school just high school and my late puberty hit me… which obviously just made everything go even more downhill a i started to get more and more masculine… it wa also very fat since so i just got fatter i wa also doing extremely subpar in highschool… which once again still made me feel empty and worthless at i miraculously entered the top university of my country for linguistics i 'm not sure how but i wa called in the 4th wait list it took me a semester of happiness but thing started to go back to a they were before… i got unmotivated quickly and noticed i chose my course wrongly a i wa hating it… around that time i wa also living by myself with my brother in são paulo and even started my hormonal therapy at in even if thing were shitty in uni i wa still losing weight and becoming more feminine and i started to blossom socially i 'd attract people that were romantically interested even went in date and made friend in bars… but then… i wa date raped one day i could n't do much about it the guy did n't leave any mark or bruise and there wa no way to prove it happened and i wa also terrified to go go the police because i wa still presenting male… and i know they 'd not take a man seriously in a rape claim… and with how homophobic and transphobic brazil is… i even feared worse… so with that… i started to just stay home cry thing off and spent month just in bed… i started to grow nearly obese again and my friend started to abandon me a i am too much of a bummer i also gad dropped uni… after a few months… my really anti-lgbt parent caught up that i wa on hormone and i wa met with the ultimatum stop it or you 're out the only thing keeping me together wa over… in month most of the progress i had of month of hormone were over a testosterone is a really potent thing… so my gender dysphoria went even more severe… nowadays i 'm just bed struck and have some social gathering i go to… i can barely look at myself in the mirror and acknowledging my genitals literally throw me in panic attacks… i 'm now back on my hormone because i really do n't care anymore… i 'm just making thing more bearable until i finally off myself… that is if brazil doe n't kill me first a my life expectancy a a trans woman here is since this country is literally the most violent towards u in the world even more than iran… in iran it 's actually socially acceptable i still have some shallow friendship but they all feel empty a i have to be a man around people… and i just ca n't take it anymore,1

it ha been a year since my fiancee walked out on me i do not feel better no one can give me the life we made together except for her and i 'd rather die than live this inferior existence i screwed up the most incredible wonderful relationship i ever could have hoped for with a girl who wa so perfect for me we travelled the world together she wa so adventurous countless country i have photo of u everywhere doing everything i do n't believe in anything supernatural but being with her wa so perfect it wa like i 'd found a soulmate unfortunately a couple of year into our year relationship i developed terrible depression and anxiety due to a really messed up childhood i tried to beat it a couple of time with sustained effort over the year but allowed it to consume me too much when you 're that depressed in your worst time you do n't realise how much you have to lose and take it for granted i took her for granted she worked out multiple time a week studied hard and got an amazing job met lot of friend and came home to me at the end of the day i put a lot on her leaning on her for support and not giving enough effort to find a decent job make friend or take care of my appearance i 'm quite naturally good looking and every time we did anything together we had incredible fun so i guess that wa enough for her to stay attracted for a long time but eventually she just saw me a needy and not the man she wanted to be with for life a month after leaving me she met a doctor who love travelling and they have been enjoying the life i always desperately wanted to have with her i spent the first six month unable to leave the house a wreck the next six i worked like crazy meeting tonne of new people and going to the gym every single morning desperately hoping she 'd see and have second thought i got promoted at work although it still not a particularly impressive position i am in a better place but no matter what i achieve i have to live with the fact that she is gone it make everything i achieve not worth it i have my apartment full of thing i want to enjoy with her it feel so empty i break down every couple of day it 's not depression i know depression better than most it 's just pure fucking sadness that she 's gone i spoke to her a few day ago about what i 've been up to i pretended to be happy hoping that she would see i 've changed she just seemed happy for me and felt comfortable telling me how happy she 's been too i just ca n't carry on like this i am so full of regret so full of pain i can be in a room with friend and feel lonely because i miss her why live like that why,1
