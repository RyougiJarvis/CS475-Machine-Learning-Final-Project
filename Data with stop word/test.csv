ha anyone here done away with their smart phone due to privacy concern since the facebook/cambridge analytica scandal began i ve majorly backed away from facebook by uninstalling it instagram and messenger from my phone and not accessing them via browser i m tempted to delete my account entirely but the point seems moot when so many other apps including reddit collect your data a well i thought one solution might be to move away from my smart phone all together in order to reasonably reduce the amount of info i voluntarily/accidentally share due to the convenience of a pocket computer but maybe that s a bit extreme which is why i m wondering what your thought are on smart phone and/or what you know about protecting your digital privacy,0

i am the definition of fear of intimacy from a young age i developed strange fantasy that were masochistic in nature my parent weren t great my dad ha a fetish for woman s clothes that become apparent when he walked up our neighborhood in this clothing a neighbor seen and called the police my mother would be capable of many thing including rage and obsessive behavior a far a i can recall i wa never physically hit and wa looked after when it came to food and clothing there were good time i worry regularly that i wa sexually abused have no real recall but try to think of event from where this could have happened for example i can not remember my first bedroom but can remember all other room is that strange we left that house when i wa aged to i think there wa also a play group from where i remember another child wa playing with themselves and believe something could have happened there i remember telling my parent on the way home that i didn t want to go back again and i don t think i did around people i trusted i wa often happy and fine but not around those i didn t other play group i d often be on my own alone untrusting anyone around others i d be very much the opposite i wa an only child and got bored easily a an adult i have had no relationship from the strange fantasy to the fear of intimacy i have avoided at all cost friendship are also close to distinct but again with those i trust i am more than ok. since my father ha strange sexual desire it fuel suspicion that he could have done something when i wa younger or i have some of the genetics i don t feel any real attraction that force me to be intimate those strange fantasy from a very young age have sadly stuck in most case i have so many thing swirling around my head at time such a wa i sexually abused but don t remember did my parent s action scar me very early a a child is it genetical do i have ocd,1

do people think your older or younger than your actual age i usually get older personality wise i have a friend who s three year older than me and i m friend with her because her sister and i have been best friend for six year well my friend who s older we ll call her racheal ha always told me there s no way your my age racheal and i often have deep talk late at night and i guess i have a more mature perspective on thing then i ve had quite a few internet friend who have always thought i wa much older than i actually am i ve been on the internet for a long time staring at a pretty young age being in the as crack of conservative texas i probably would of had more conservative view and whatnot but from being online at such a young age i got to hear the perspective of thing from different people i guess that s what s shaped me to have a more mature personality because i always hung out with people who were much older the thing is i never told any of my internet friend my age and they think i m year older than i actually am then look wise i ve not ever had one person tell me that i seemed older than i actually wa i feel like i look my age but i think from how i dress people think i m a few year older also my voice probably ha a lot to do with that too i naturally have a lower voice especially when i talk to people who aren t my friend my voice tends to sink down into my throat and get a bit lower do you often get mistaken for being older or younger than you actually are,0

i ca n't even think of where to begin i wake up in the morning and it 's such a struggle to get out of bed i feel that it 's no use no matter what i do i get no relief of this shitty feeling i 'm constantly miserable every moment of the day i want to scream i feel i 'm constantly holding in vomit and when it come up i have to keep it down and take it i tried a routine a a distraction work exercise cooking cleaning a hobby none of those thing are enjoyable but i do it because i 'm told that it 's good for me then i feel trapped because i ca n't just do whatever or be spontaneous i force myself to go out with 'friends but i do n't share their interest i 'm so uncomfortable the whole time and feel that i do n't belong i smile and pretend to care i hate it because it 's so fake i 'm tired of pretending to be okay when i just want to cry i guess there are time when i 'm not good at faking a smile because people will ask if i 'm ok and i 'll tell them yes what else can i say i 've been in that position before they tell me to go to a doctor and i 've already done this the medicine helped for like a few month but i think that wa the false sense of well being side effect i ca n't even think how to describe depression to them without a long story that will make them look at me like i 'm insane x200b i 've thought about how i 'd kill myself and almost did it the only reason i did n't is because of my mother and not for the reason you think she always say those who commit suicide are weak they ca n't handle life etc she say it with such disgust in her voice she know of my struggle with depression and i just do n't want to prove her right i do n't want to give her the satisfaction of being 'right i 'm so frustrated with everything and everyone in my life every thing i do is a waste of time there 's no point in even trying anymore i 'm about to start a new job i lied to myself saying it 's a new beginning but i 'm not looking forward to it at all i should be excited but i 'm not x200b i 'm so confused about everything i want to have friend and be normal and do normal thing that a woman in her 20 would do but i do n't even know how to make friend it 's strange because i wa so social when i wa younger but now i have no confidence with low self esteem i ca n't even push myself to try to meet people i do n't have any genuine interest in anything i considered meeting people but i 'm afraid i 'll sit there with nothing to say looking weird if i did make a friend i would n't believe that they actually like me the same is for meeting guy valentine 's day is soon and it kill me this time of year is terrible because i have no one i do n't know where to meet guy and i fear they wo n't actually like me i 'm also incredibly picky and i know the guy i want do n't want me because of how i look i just hate it it 's so strange how i can go from normal to being so detached and i do n't give a fuck but i kind of do about everything,1

prepare for a large emotional dump because i have no friend i 'm not seeking advice or anything just kind word and encouragement i guess i 'm a sophomore and to summarize me i wa basically that class clown kid you know that kid that you either thought wa super funny or super annoying that 's me and i 'm still capable of being that person but it 's more just because i feel like i need to be that person because well fuck like i said before a handful of people find that person funny if i 'm gon na be sad on the inside personal trauma that have nothing to do with the topic i might a well attempt to make some people laugh and smile but a i grow up i just wonder what 's the point of anything i just feel stuck like there 's no point to anything like by living i 'm being set up to fail like i have no chance to ever truly be happy and i think that ha a lot to do with school school is just touted a being this massively important thing that set everything else up which i guess it is but fuck i 'm awful at school and the curriculum is fucking broken i 've been in algebra for like year i 'm stupid i ca n't pas it and yet when i 'm a junior i 'm gon na be expected to take the same exact quiz that the super smart kid in fucking pre calc take and if i do n't pas that i do n't graduate i mean it 's shit like that that 's like well fuck i do n't have a fucking chance i like writing story and drawing picture but reading writing those are n't necessary class to graduate nor do they get you any respect in the system you can draw really well you 're creative so what how good are you at mental math i just wa n't born with the right talent and interest to survive in school my 8th grade teacher showed u all this cartoon called animal school that had four thing they graded the animal on running climbing swimming and flying a duckling for instance wa good at flying and swimming but it wa bad at climbing so it had to drop swimming to become an adequate climber in the end it became just average at everything not exceeding in anything that 's a fantastic analogy for school i feel it 's a if school forget that there are career where you can be creative just a there are career where you have to do math and shit even though i feel that by the time i fully grow up any time i 'll find myself in a situation at work that i have to do math i 'll have some computer or robot that 'll help because you know time is money no need to waste it doing math in your head or on your finger but let 's say i do buckle down and pas that dumbass fucking test well for what now what i pas my senior year and graduate i do n't even know who i am i do n't know what i want to do and it 's so hard to sludge through school when i do n't even know what i 'm doing it for i have no ambition no dream no real goal i 'm just kindaaaa i do n't know what the word is i guess floating through life like a cloud and i 'm starting to worry about the future from what i here a high school diploma is basically meaningless the college degree are where it 's at but like i said i do n't know what i want to do what am i willing to throw huge sum of money at for the chance just the chance to eventually work in that field college is just a much a gamble a the lottery the way i see it there 's really no guarantee about anything i can go to college and get a degree and then not even be able to job in the career i want anywhere because fuck i do n't know maybe they 'd rather hire a woman to diversify then how am i gon na have to pay off that debt if i just say fuck college and stick to my diploma or ged well getting a high paying job or even a job that pay enough for me to fucking buy food after all the goddamn hidden utility is gon na be difficult and there 's still no guarantee they would n't hire a dropout over me it 's just what is the point i feel that my future is hopeless and my present is n't any good all my friend have pretty much left me my two best friend both moved first one got wrapped up in drug and got sent to a boy home and is probably gon na end up staying in ohio second well she 's just in a shitty relationship that she wo n't end for good she got mad at me for telling it how it wa and now well i guess we are n't talking right now the only person i really have left is my girlfriend and she 's great but she 's always got a crowd of people around her because she 's just really approachable and i just fuck i just do n't wan na drag her down with my presence nor do i wan na push my way through everyone just to find myself claustrophobic in the middle nobody 's gon na read all of this and i do n't know what you would say if you did i do n't feel like i 'm depressed mostly because i do n't really have like trouble getting out of bed or nothing i can still smile and all that truthfully i just do n't wan na potentially disrespect depressed people by calling what i have depression i think it 's just hopelessness i do n't know i hope you have a good day thanks for reading,1

the usual teen poetry phase some got printed in a literary magazine when i wa so maybe they were n't all that crappy but i stopped doing that in early high school because it felt a bit embarrassing to be that chick who writes poem i probably would n't have had there been anybody else in my class or school with whom i could have worked together to create something interesting like a book song lyric some literary project a webzine or literary journal especially the last one but there wa n't anybody and that never happened so i switched to translating p,0
bookcon ^^^^i ^^^^spent ^^^^of ^^^^my ^^^^spring ^^^^break ^^^^doing ^^^^any ^^^^of ^^^^the ^^^^school ^^^^work ^^^^i ^^^^needed ^^^^to ^^^^oh ^^^^i can not ^^^^wait ^^^^for ^^^^graduation last year on the first weekend of june i went to an event called bookcon http //www.thebookcon.com/ it wa exactly what it sound like a convention for book reader and author i went solo because i like getting book by myself and i figured i 'd be able to see more of what i wanted to without having to appeal to someone else 's taste it wa an all right experience i got a good amount of book a few were signed by the author standing there and or were free a far a i know there really were n't any big name there unless you went to the meet and greet area but when i looked at that list i did n't see anybody who i had actually read before and only a very small handful of name i recognized despite working in a library for four year so i did n't bother waiting in line for any of those there were also some panel going on and i went to two one about sci-fi and incorporating politics into the fictional world it wa n't a interesting to me a i thought it wa gon na be and the other wa about how much of an impact the rise in the ya subgenre is having on teen and reading and it wa actually more interesting than i thought it wa gon na be i gave the day overall maybe a outta because i wa expecting more than what i got but that did n't put me off from never going again i just remembered the other day the bookcon should be coming up in june so i looked online at the list of panel and oh my goodness i 'm actually overwhelmed by all the panel that seem interesting i 'm planning on going to the saturday of the convention because all the panel i am interested fall on that day but the problem is there are a few that fall at the same or similar time a each other and i have to choose what i am most interested in attending to start off from 9-11am i have to decide if i want to attend the sci-fi and fantasy writing workshop or the fiction writing workshop both of these cost extra but are the same price unlike the rest of the panel and i am interested in both i am more used to writing plain fiction and i think i would have an easier time writing sample from the prompt given there but i also really enjoy reading sci-fi/fantasy and yet i never write it because well a bunch of reason that workshop claim it 'll help focus on how to combine mind-bending world-building with a powerful narrative drive quoted from the website so i have to figure out which i want to attend more then there is a panel called when reality is stranger than fiction that is from which interrupt both the writing workshop session but it sound kinda cool about how thriller/mystery writer are basically competing with grasping audience when what is going on in the news is more compelling than made up event i think though that if i have to miss this panel for the workshop i wont be too disappointed the next panel that sound interesting is from 11-11:50am and that is called horror thrill murder oh my and it is about building suspense in writing across genre it sound pretty cool and i 'm sure i could catch most of it after the writing workshop i attend a few other panel go on but none that really catch my eye again until around 12:45-1:30pm where a panel that discus world building and how to make that interesting is going on this time with one author who i recognize but never read before i think learning from that would be cool the next panel that interest me is called magic and power at 3:45-4:45pm ha a bunch of author that i recognize but again have n't read and it 's talking about fantasy book and how magic/power affect the struggle their character face and stuff like that the last panel that i am interested in is called into the booth a glimpse into audiobooks at 4:45-5:30pm i 've never listened to an audiobook but my real dream job ha always been to be an audio engineer in a recording studio so it 'll be cool to sit in on that and just learn about how recording for book are made there were a few other panel that looked like they might be interesting but not enough for me to really go this give me a jam packed day of learning cool thing about book and writing and in the down time i 'll maybe have between panel session i can walk around the showroom floor and get book meet author and hopefully this time be a bit more talkative with them cause i had no idea what to talk about with any of them last year and just enjoy being around other book lover the sunday panel i am sure are also interesting but when i looked at them they did n't stand out a much a all the one i mentioned here did i remember one of my coworkers thought the idea of bookcon wa lame but he go to comiccon almost every year so who is the real nerd here i 'll be sure to tell him i 'm going to bookcon again this year whenever we work together again have you ever been to a convention for anything before would learning about different element of writing like those mentioned in the panel i want to attend interest you are you someone who enjoys reading book if so what kind ever been part of a

you start by giving someone a couple anxiogenic drug n-methyl-ß-carboline-3-carboxamide is a really powerful one used in animal testing and it will make you feel terrible especially in combination with the also anxiogenic gaba agonist pentylenetetrazol or something at this stage they 'll be breathing very hard freaking the fuck out with an extremely urgent sense of impending doom without exactly knowing why may a well add an adrenergic drug to really get the heart beating and keep them from falling asleep on you later not one of the fun one though give someone enough and just blowing lightly on their skin will be enough to raise goosebump so it doe add something to the torturer 's repertoire imo follow this up with a long-acting opiate antagonist like naltrexone it 'll help prevent the body from mediating upcoming pain now rub the leaf of the gympie tree all over their skin probably they 'll die sorry if i got carried away just fantasizing here x200b x200b,0

i used to be anti-social until middle school i walked up and started talking to other people and found a group of people i spent so much time with them during middle school they were so out going that i could n't keep up because my parent are so strict i wa force to say no whenever they want to hang out so that group all stopped inviting me and then stopped talking to me then high-school came i knew nobody and it took me a moth to say i 'm sick of feeling alone so i interrupted a girl talking about video game and started talking to her from the day i did that she introduced me to so many people and talked to many of them they became my friend but nothing more than that the girl i talked to that day taught me to cut school and stop being so uptight i cut school but i did all my work so my grade did n't get affected a much i gave her all my time and attention when i graduated from high school she got herself a group of people from our school to hang out and play online i wa fun i got close to them and felt like they were my people until one day we noticed she did n't care about u she 'd go hanging out with other people and trust me shes a social butterfly so she can make friend in an instant where ever she go she started not joining our little party in xbox and were with her online friend instead i found out from the guy in our group that shes just using them for their company and not giving a sh/t about u whenever we talked to her she would avoid u at all cost until one day we decided to let her go one of the guy in our group that wa way closer to her wa hurt the most because she abused him the most mentally i tried to be there and fix the problem but nobody want to listen to me i tried to be there for everybody but everyone just seemed dead inside after she left i talked to each one and try to be supportive and never minded how i feel i manage to get that guy to move one from his feeling he had because since he got close to her he ended up liking her but a obvious the answer is she rejected him i got him to go back to college work on himself and how he feel and find a job he started liking me and kept saying i love you often played a lot together and visited me at my house often i told him i 'm not mentally prepared for relationship and that i still reside with my parent so i 'm not exactly free he said he will wait we have argument and big one too i felt obligated to go to him first so i did and talked to him and explain him how i felt until again we kept having the same argument it hurt but i just suck it up and try to fix the problem until one day he say i never asked for these shoe you gave me for my birthday i never asked you to help me get through what i 'm going through i wa gon na go and do it my self anyways i felt offended but i felt really sad in the end i just ignored it because he wa going through a lot of stuff until he kept treating me like an acquaintance he ignored my message and forget what plan we had with our group when were alone he 'd tell me he lonely and nobody 's there for him then the girl he liked came back to him asking him to be friend i warned him and told him to stay away from her he did n't even though he said i 'm never going to get close to her like that anymore after that he kept talking to her and i felt like an app running in the background someone you can go back to whenever you can i started to feel sick of the being left off so i blocked him out of nowhere i thought what 's the point of talking to him about it it the same thing it did n't even feel like he loved me at all i am just a temporary till he feel better because if he love me he would n't ignore me at all.and so on during that time they other people in our group just started doing their own stuff not caring what happens so the group fell apart i remember one time i tried to speak up and told the group that there 's something wrong with our group and i wa basically told to f/ck off and deal with it by myself i wa so tired of that feeling and started to drift off i block that dude out of nowhere and he came to my house to return the keychain i gave him once i asked him is he want to say something and left i did n't know what to feel i 'm so exhausted of feeling ignored and just that person who the only one trying for the group now that i took the action to cut them off it hurt a lot i feel like a big part of me is gone i try and try to deal with it by distracting myself with video game so i wont think about suicide nor those hurtful thing but it doe n't work i do n't want to self pity myself nor have people pity me i am being a hypocrite because i 'm writing this in the internet what can i do i have no one else to talk to and say these thing to whoever read this all the way to the end thank you so much for your time i know i wrote a a lot,1

i 'm too much of a coward i put the belt around my neck and around the pole in my closet but i could n't bring myself to tighten it but strangely i felt very peaceful right before when i figured i should just end thing right here and now but when i had the belt around me i just got scared that it would hurt and i just imagined how horrific my dead body would look so i could n't do it i should do it but i ca n't i almost sent a goodbye text to someone i have n't spoken to in month would they even care i doubt it and i 'm being completely serious when i say that i keep staring at the belt because i know it 's my real only way out i 've already reached my peak and now it 's over the rest is just more of this more pain and more failure and more delusion i need to get out i wish i had the courage,1
idk if this is common or not but i hate it when people care about me i see a lot of post about people talking about how they wish others cared about them but to me it seems like life would be easier if nobody gave a fuck about me or anything that i did for one i could do thing that i wanted to do and not do the thing that i didn t i wouldn t have to give into pressure by my family and peer and i could go do some shit like move to australia or something i don t think that i would feel a tied down for two if that australia plan didn t work out i could just kill myself without any hesitation or apprehension about my family s feeling i could finally allow myself to rest but instead i m stuck with not many but a few people who would probably end up in the same state of mind that i m in if i died i can t bring myself put them in that position so instead i go on suffering for them life is miserable,1

too many the sixth suicide just happened at my high school this year there were another three that happened in december nobody is glorifying it nobody even know unless they ask around or go to the funeral it s starting to sound like the norm another hanging an od hell one kid floored it into the back of a school bus i knew most of them seen them around it s very different hearing of a death then seeing the empty seat right next to you i ve made two attempt on my life and i remember feeling so alone and empty inside i still do sometimes every time i hear what these kid are going through and how alone they feel all i can think is we were here ready to listen unfortunately it s not that simple we all know how severely alienating this disease is we all know how ugly it is and there s no end in sight i don t know what to do other than keep living every time one of my friend end it it strengthens my resolve to keep going to survive for them and everyone else who is struggling to prove that this monster can be killed if not at least tamed at first i m angry at them then at their circumstance suicide ha already taken so much away from me and i refuse to give it the satisfaction of giving up the grim reaper will have one hell of a time getting to me you can be sure of that,1
my awareness of this fill me with a deep sadness that make unable to do anything productive i 've been depressed for year now and the more i feel this way the more i see how important it is to love i do n't know how much longer i 'm going to live it 's too hard but while i 'm still here i just want to tell everyone that i love you i love everyone i only wish everyone could read this and know how much i do,1

i obsessively segment reverse and visualize word in my head i also count the amount of letter in the word i am constantly taking word i hear or see throughout the day and breaking them into piece in my head for instance the word hospital would become hos-pi-tal to keep an even amount of letter on each side of a pivotal couple of letter in the middle it could also become hosp-ital but that 's le satisfying if it 's a word with an odd number of letter i 'll only put one letter in the middle such a chev-r-olet not a commonly i 'll reverse word and pronounce them backwards also in my head i also count the letter in the word i 'm visualizing so if someone were to ask me how many letter are in the word conversation i would be able to instantly answer without having to think because i 've ran most of the common word through my head dozen if not hundred of time i also take the first letter or two of two word and swap them so saying i 'm going to take a shower turn into i 'm going to shake a tower i 'm a fully functioning adult with a great career so this doe n't impact me financially in any way but it doe on occasion cause me to get lost in the word manipulation and i stop listening to people normally i can do all of this and still listen but some of the tougher longer word cause me to really get quite in-depth i 'm not aggressively seeking answer to what this is i 've always just attributed it to me being weird but if someone ha insight a to what it might be i 'd love to discus it i 'd also like to discus similar habit others might have i do n't have a lot of cont-ig-uous time to reply but i 'll be on and off of reddit the rest of the afternoon,0

now first off i feel it 's imperative to say that i have n't officially been diagnosed with anything in fact i have n't even talked to anyone about how awful i 've been feeling the past year or so however i feel i definitely have a lot of the symptom that those diagnosed with depression have also of note i do not feel suicidal at all i suppose the title of this post is a bit hyperbole but i wa thinking that if i did talk to someone and they prescribed some type of medication i would not feel comfortable with taking it i mean for one i have a lack of faith that it would even work but maybe that 's just me being cynical and/or naive and for another it seems like even if it did work it would lead to a contrived happiness a opposed to a genuine happiness even just talking to someone i feel like i would n't properly be able to open up about what i 've been going through and sometimes i feel like and this is going to sound just awful that i 'm just using depression a an excuse or outlet for just being lazy or not taking an initiative in life i mean there are time where i am happy it 's just seems like a rare occurrence i feel like i 'm feeling sorry for myself i mean i have a great job i 'm only i make very good money have a nice car/apartment etc but something just ha n't been feeling right and it seems like it 's a combination of multiple factor it seems like it would all be an exercise in futility maybe instead of talking to someone or taking medication i just need an escape via some new activity or something i just feel a though an attempt at trying find genuine happiness is very stressful and borderline impossible,1

i understand this is an extremely morbid title and perhaps i 'm wrong maybe i am truly just projecting my experience on to him but something clicked in my mind a of late my friend wa an extremely outgoing person he wa loved by everyone he met always a smile on his face he cared about everybody and most importantly he cared about himself he had the biggest ego out of anyone i knew always talking about how he 's the this or that i remember talking to him about being more attractive especially to girl he gave me advice about going to the gym how to make your personality better basically how to have a positive attitude like his own then in september of last year he jumped off the balcony of his apartment which wa on the 30-something floor this shocked everyone i honestly thought it wa a joke when my friend told me the first time they had to repeat themselves multiple time to register it in my head this guy the guy who wa basically my role model and close friend just died by his own hand it made no sense why why would he do this he seemed happy he wa going to school to do what he loved it made no sense the morning he did it he sent an email to my friend it wa worded poorly i 'm sure his brain wa not fully functioning at that point he said his goodbye that he wa sorry that he wa being selfish all that stuff but he wrote something that i did n't really put into consideration at all and that wa the fact that he said he truly wa n't sad that he wa simply done i did n't get it at all i mean i did to an extent but i could n't understand how a guy like him would just say fuck it and end it all like that but then recently i 've been going through a ton of personal growth i 'm seeing the world through new eye and honestly through a lens i feel like he wa looking through too because i have been striving to become the best person i can to become number one to have a great personality to improve myself to the best i can and like i said something connected the fact that i 'm doing all of this shit all of this work for what why the more i improve myself the shittier everything seems i work so hard just to suffer through a shit job or a shit class or a shit relationship a shitty everything i have to maintain a fake a fuck frame pretending everything is so cool and great when in reality i 'm stressed probably sick in some form and not to mention over all just lonely and that 's just the thing it 's being lonely maybe he wa n't lonely maybe he wa just truly done but i feel like that 's the thing that pushed him over and it 's not a silly boo-hoo i have nobody to talk to or a friend are n't talking to me at this moment kind of lonely it 's the kind of crippling loneliness that come from realizing that nothing matter that nobody matter you do n't matter she doe n't matter he doe n't matter nothing matter nobody owes you anything and at first this thought process wa freeing wow nothing matter nice of course this did n't mean i went around punching people or breaking law but it opened my eye up to how i could become someone better that because nothing really matter i should n't worry about thing a much that there 's no reason to stress over what i say what i do how i act just to loosen up and have fun this wa great my ego went through the roof adopting this nihilistic point of view and not in a necessarily negative way i just felt good to be me which wa surprising and addictive but eventually lead to me feeling like this once i started working on me me and more of me i started looking around i stopped putting people on a pedestal and realized that people fucking suck i very might a well be one of those super sucky people but from my point of view i 'm somewhat decent i realized how empty and shallow people are that people basically go for look or a loud/obnoxious personality and i understand many people step all over the whole defending of being a nice guy sort of thing but stepping out of those line and becoming a somewhat obnoxious guy that only care about himself and his look just suck i become one of those people i view a empty and i hate it but it terrifies me to step down and go back into a position where i wa constantly being stepped on and literally abused this is creating a tear in my personality and life making thing ridiculously difficult and this is where i feel like he gave up and i ca n't blame him i feel like i 'm stuck between a rock and a hard place i 'm told to just be my self but when i am i 'm ignored and used when i put on a persona walk around doing some act i feel empty what the hell am i supposed to even do adding this on top of the stress of growing up watching my friend suffer because they 're too poor to even afford food on some day seeing that the planet is going to shit the government is being ran by people that do n't give a shit about the average person that people are a a whole are simply vain and predictable it just suck it seems so nice to just be rid of it i 'm

my older brother and sister refer to me a the angel child because of this apparently i can do no wrong in the eye of our mother,0
do you think it 's condescending to tell a child 'your parent raised you well i remember my mother telling me off when i wa eleven for going to school with muddy trouser i 'd played a bit of rugby after school and wore the same trouser the next day without washing them because i did n't consider it much of a problem at the time my mum wa upset that i had n't washed them or wore clean one and when it wa clear that i did n't understand the problem at all she threw in that it also make teacher think that she 's not looking after me i did n't understand this at the time because in my mind it wa my responsibility to wash my clothes not hers but a i got older this memory stuck with me and i realised it 's the truth the way a child act and appears reflects massively on the parent but a a child i did n't view it that way so my question come from last night i wa playing the game fortnite battle royale and for those not familiar with the game you can get paired up with three other stranger and have to work together to beat all the other team teamwork is essential and using your microphone to chat is also really useful i wa paired up with a twelve-year-old boy and two american college student i do n't usually like playing with child but this kid wa pretty polite and a nice guy to play with he wa n't good at the game but he did his best to share all the item he got with the team and gave u all the info he had so no problem there something that bugged me though is that the two other guy repeatedly told him 'your parent raised you well whenever he said please/thank you or helped u out he always replied with an awkward laugh and a 'thanks but to me it seems condescending to say that kind of thing i did n't speak up at the time because that would make thing awkward thinking back to my muddy trouser story when i wa a child i disliked people relating my action to my parent what do you guy think about this kind of thing,0
hi all my best friend ha had a really rough past mo they ve gone through almost any bad thing that you can think of and they re crumbling i can tell they are and they know they are a well i don t know how to help them we got into a small argument about something stupid recently and i feel like they re avoiding me since and i ve been trying to reach out but nothing is working they haven t talked to anybody about what s going on and it s beyond stressing me out i just don t want anything to happen to them i know the feeling of being in such a low of wanting to kill myself and they re on the brink of reaching that point they re in the point of not wanting to live but they re not suicidal i don t know if it s the stress of them being so off about not being in contact with me and me just constantly worrying or if the whole situation is just throwing my brain back into where i used to be a few year ago but i feel like it s directly affecting me now more than it should like a if it s triggering me to fall back into my depression because i never got real help for it i have no regard for school or anything that i wa focused on last semester i don t care about work a much anymore and i just want to cry constantly i feel like i m having a mental breakdown i just don t know what to do i don t know how to help them since they re acting like this now and i don t know how to stop reacting to this in the way my brain is reacting to it i don t know if it s necessarily possible for depression to be triggered again by someone else suffering from it i just i don t know what to do or how to do it tl dr my best friend is going through it bad depressed and hating existence but not suicidal i m pretty sure i don t know how to help them i also think it might be triggering my depression that i never got professional help for when i wa younger i don t know what to do,1
why do so many of u want to die i might be asking on the wrong subreddit but i also have suicidal thought my reason are probably way le severe than any of yours i feel worthless that i have nothing to contribute no special skill or talent no interest no one need me since they have others i ca n't study since i hate myself so much and i ca n't find work unless i get a degree in something the competition for low-end job is tough since even those need certain degree i still live with my mom when most others live on their own she is a bit tricky to live with i do n't think she is noticing how bad i feel she want me to do more when i already feel like i 'm at my limit i wrote a will yesterday but i have n't decided yet if i 'm gon na do it or not sorry if it 's not convincing i get that it 's just another thing that i 'm apparently worthless at so what are your reason hope i 'm not breaking any rule i 'm only asking for the reason not the method,1

how do you deal with extreme emotion if you experience them at all i 'm talking anger depression whatever mostly negative emotion i guess because those are the one which require management right personally i 've been hitting the gym i started realizing it might even help fuel my workout when i went while really angry one day i ran for like minute straight which wa really surprising to me since i do n't usually have that much stamen it did n't feel like a long time either because of the adrenaline i 've been trying to cope by going to the gym ever since the only con is sometimes people look at me weird because i look a little too determined when i 'm angry or a little too lost in my own thought when i 'm sad oh and some day i feel like cry at the gym but i just try to focus on my workout i 'd like to find a more peaceful way to cope if possible or at least something i can do at any time at home i do yoga but it doe n't make my body feel exhausted so my mind still wanders i used to really enjoy going to the gym but these day i automatically feel bad because i associate it with these emotion and i do n't really want that anyway do share what always make you feel better,0

agreed i had a really hard start to adulthood i 'd been emotionally abused pretty severely for my childhood which escalated a i got older i had a lot of health issue a a kid that hit me like a truck in adulthood i 'd just broken up with my first love because he 'd started getting violent with me over his unfounded jealousy he hurt me when i told him i wa n't going to drop out of the school play he wa angry and jealous because i played the female lead and had to kiss my gay costar i started college where my ex also attended and somehow despite the university being massive he just happened to make friend with guy in my re hall and wa there all the time so then i felt like i could n't make friend with those guy i wa really isolated i started getting really sick from stress sleep deprivation and depression which wa terrible since i wa a double major in two program that require the highest number of class i wa taking class at once one of which wa a lab another wa multi-hour rehearsal for the opera and one of those program vocal performance deeply depended on my health i wa on way too many medication a the campus doctor had gotten into the unfortunate here 's a medication to treat the side effect of the previous medication cycle one of those medication wa a steroid that they put me on for over a month that deeply impacted my mental health since i could n't sleep or eat and wa drinking so much water that my doctor wa making me track and limit it then my ex raped me one night the trauma really fucked me up after a lifetime of abuse and just desperately wanting to be loved by someone it just felt like a confirmation that i wa n't worth loving and like no one would ever treat me like a human being i developed an eating disorder of course i could n't tell my parent one of them wa abusive and untrustworthy and would absolutely retraumatize me my biodad wa n't even interested in my life or well being and would n't have cared and my mom would have just folded and told my stepdad bringing u to reason so i had to go back to living with my parent while i went through the arduous process of getting a diagnosis for what had fucked my health up so badly i wa also living in constant pain and my doctor said it wa pretty common for trauma illness and extreme stress to trigger chronic health condition i 'd stopped eating regularly in college but when i had to come home that 'd when it turned into something purposeful a opposed to just not being hungry or not being able to bring myself to nourish my body due to depression the anorexia got really bad over the next couple year i 'd transferred to another university and wa in my second year there when i hit rock bottom i wa and wearing child 's size pant because there literally were n't pant small enough the therapist i wa seeing at a pain clinic wa so concerned that he wa basically begging me to eat something looking back i realize now that he probably wa figuring out at which point he 'd have to put me in the hospital against my will but i literally could n't eat even though i could see that i wa way way too thin i kept losing weight even though i did n't even want to at that point my bmi wa around at the worst point i 'd completely stopped eating solid food for day and all i could choke down wa cup of a fruit smoothie i could n't even walk to get water without collapsing i knew i wa going to die soon and my parent were doing nothing so i had to make the call i decided i wanted to live so i called the eating disorder intensive treatment center and set up an evaluation for two day from them i drove home from college only two hour away from home so i came back frequently and told my parent my mom wa frustratingly in denial went to the evaluation and my mom said maybe they 'll tell you there 's nothing wrong with you i wanted to strangle her the doctor were concerned there wa a month wait list to get into this place but they decided to take me in the next day since i would need to be hospitalized otherwise i pretty successfully pushed through it had other setback untreated ptsd come out in other self destructive way when you have n't treated that a the root which i had n't really i got into a much better mental place although my relationship with abusive dad got really bad and it nearly pushed me over the edge when i wa still in a dark place a couple month after i 'd gotten my shit together and wa doing better i ended up meeting a guy who is now my husband year later,0

would you share embarrassing tip to help acquaintance i work in a professional environment a a traveling salesman kind of gig and i have maybe coworkers over location i see face to face once or twice a month a i do my round i keep it very casual with them my rank is higher than theirs but in a different space so i see them more a equal and encourage them to see me a one too so they are n't afraid to email me or call me to make a sale anyways usually i talk to the younger guy about wardrobe trip where to find sharper looking outfit for le to the younger girl about how to deal with and deter harassment and to everyone about career development in general to break the ice and develop working relationship with them a a result they see me a this kind of coach figure right i recently lost a lot of weight lb in month using a diet pill prescribed by a gynecologist i 'm male referred by a close friend who also had similar success i 'm happy with the result and experience and when i stopped taking the pill and saw the weight stayed down i recommended it to my closest friend then i told my wife i cant wait to tell so and so at work about it and she told me not to say anything about the pill because it kind of embarrassing and like cheating so it may damage my reputation at work she made a compelling argument for it so i agreed since nobody had asked me so far anyway when i began to visit my location after my little transformation had proven permanent without the pill at first they didnt say anything but then they began to comment how they were all shocked and asked how i did it specially the heavier set people obviously i just thanked them for the compliment and said work ha been so busy ive been skipping meal almost daily and drinking a lot of water instead of soda to avoid stomach ache this wa all true and they saw it for themselves and casually tested me about never seeing me eat in the past so they bought it and said at first they did n't want to ask because they did n't want to be inappropriate and then offered me food lol but it feel wrong there 's at least co-worker with big event coming up in the summer and they would benefit so much from this pill but in reality we are n't friend just aquaintances and while i would be happy if they spread the word so others can try it and see if it work i am indeed worried my name would piggy back on it each time it 's brought up,0
i 'm really feeling close to ending it i just do n't see a whole lot of reason to go on first there 's my ongoing problem a year old who is depressed and never leaf home i have no motivation or aspiration they 've all been drained out of me over the year and ha been almost entirely depleted and even then i always wanted something outside of my ability i 'm book smart and that 's it math memory etc stuff in the brain but i never wanted that for myself i 've lost a lot of interest in video game and i ca n't shut myself away and listen to music because my father wo n't let me complained it 's too loud but if i can hear anything it defeat the purpose plus he go around with his monotone singing and he can hear his music and he doe n't care which brings up a more recent point my father ha begun drinking hard liquor a lot of it he 's become emotionally abusive insulting his kid and his girlfriend my mother despite her making the sole income and i do n't like confrontation so i just shut down whenever he get in my or anyone else 's face my older brother kept him in check but he ha moved out i have nowhere to go i did n't have any real friend in high school ca n't go there to calm myself i ca n't get a job i 'm too anxious to go asking for one and i 'm prone to screwing thing up i usually just listened to music and kept to myself but a i said i ca n't do that anymore i ca n't even go for a walk because i know i 'm going to get scolded about that so to sum up no support nowhere to go terrible home situation no longer any suitable escapism i 've been depressed since age maybe earlier i 've getting the urge to just literally lay in bed and sleep because sleep is the only time i feel safe and okay i 've never committed major self-harm but my will to live is getting consumed day by day i do n't think i have the courage to end it but who know it 's becoming more and more an attractive option can someone just i do n't know what do i do,1

probably photography i already get into a lot of hobby but i m trying to make those hobby my profession a lot of those thing are painting graphic design video production etc those are already expensive enough but i have most of what i need for them mainly a computer a basic dslr and an adobe subscription but to become a professional photographer is more about paying to be good because you need lot of damn good lens that cost a minimum of each and more expensive high quality camera that probably go into the 1000 i m sure people could have all that high tech equipment and still not be that great at photography but it doesn t seem likely thats just one hobby/profession thats all about how much you re willing to dish out the skill come fairly easy after that,0

one of my many reason to why i feel depressed is because of my brother when i wa young my parent thought nothing would become out of me because i would lie my way out of staying at home and playing video game obviously with time it stopped and i started finding interest in going to school and becoming something and i graduated high school with marginally good grade right now im working part time and studying now what ha my brother to do with this well they thought he would become something big but they were so wrong they have a son who is about to turn year old and that lie his way out of staying at home instead of going to work and this ha been happening for year and my parent are sadly swallowing it and not doing anything about it they just get pissed when i get mad because of it he is fucking living off my dad and mom i just graduated and have earned more money than what he ha ever done i want him to have good functioning life but he keep ruining everything not only for him but for everyone i hate to say this but im slowly getting tired of him and i want to move just for this reason however my parent doe n't let me i have no reason for it school is close to me and so is work i can see sadness in my parent eye why ca n't my brother see it sorry for this big rant im just so sad and also sad about the hatred i feel towards my own brother but i feel so sorry for my parent,1
my classmate is amazing hi just going to share something i have a classmate let 's call him k who is really good at a subject while the majority of u are struggling the subject content is pretty heavy and most of u are attempting to cram for our mid-years and dying of stress it 's a subject that is not commonly covered in high school and we have an external lecturer to teach u plus we may be one hardworking class but we are n't exactly the smartest a a whole so k being the smart kid proceeds to make and distribute worksheet for u to do once every two day actual worksheet a far a we know he 's piecing all of the question together with past year paper and class practice he release the answer a day later and go through the difficult question during recess we all are really grateful to him and the effort he put in he even put cool inside joke and other funny stuff into the question no one else aside from the member of our class know about this yet and he 's doing all of this pro bono so i just want his action to be appreciated he 'd kill me if he find out about this post though so i 'm hoping that he doe n't use reddit p doe anyone know other smart kid who go out of their way to help their weaker friend edit grammar,0

hi i just had my 4th funeral in year for yet another marine a few day ago another one called me with a gun to his head and i talked him down these marine a far a i can tell suffer/suffered from depression pretty much every one of them wa intelligent like way too smart for the marine corp and each of them stood out a the funny one to say very few people understood they were struggling would be an understatement the marine corp ha done a lot to try and help suicidal marine but all our training video depict some clearly distressed person telegraphing an intent to harm themselves in reality none of these people let on the depth of their suffering and only one made an attempt to seek help what i 'm asking a someone who ha never suffered depression ive been depressed but that wa from external factor like a job not working out or a girl leaving me i consider that normal human emotion how do i identify marine under my care thst may be suffering and need help they are not giving the outward sign in the stupid lance corporal decker video we watch once a year thanks edit been at work all day then went to visit a former marine that dealt with some serious issue in his day but is doing well now mulled over a lot of this with him then checked back in here and saw all these wonderful response i have read every one some several time i have a lot to consider and learn but thank you for helping me find some direction one thing i did n't mention is my role in all this im not sone big wig commander with tool at my disposal im a newly promoted sergeant and a squad leader with just a handful of guy under me the one we just burried wa not in my platoon but i knew him enough to be deeply saddened by his loss the other three were guy i wa close to back in training but i wa not currently stationed with them when it happened in fact i found out about all three of them on facebook this recent one and the one that called me with suicidal thought have made me want to be much more aware of the mental health of those around me the scary thing to me is even with hindsight i would n't have picked these five guy out of the lot a having any kind of issue let alone suicidal tendency i have also noticed maybe because of my nature or leadership style that im the one people tend come to with problem i make it known that im here for that purpose and people take me up on it so i guess now i want to make sure i can spot when someone need more help than they may be openly asking for i will be more vigilant in my assessment of the need of those under my watch thank you all for the detailed and informed reply,1

do you like yourself love yourself so much a much a you want to be loved i know that i should do this but there are just time that i really ca n't i think there are more thing that i do n't like a bout myself than the think i like first physically i do n't really like how i look sometimes i ca n't really say that i 'm ugly it 's just that i 'm bigger and look more mature than other girl of my age i know i can change it by exercising and eating the right food but you know it 's just so hard to be trapped in a sluggish body that like eating i know it 's just a matter of self-discipline and i really need to practice this more that 's also one of the thing i do n't like about me i 'm lacking self-discipline too sensitive and emotional over-thinker quick-tempered and cry easily i also do n't trust myself regarding my decision in life there are a lot of thing that i find unlovable about myself and it get worse when i hear what people say about me i read from somewhere these line sometimes we need someone to accept u and love u first then we would learn to see ourselves through that person 's eye and learn to love ourselves. maybe it 's like that maybe it would be so much easier to love myself when i met that someone who love me a i am but of course i still want to give my self a pat on the back for trying my best everyday i still want to try to love myself more after all me myself a much a anybody in the entire universe deserve my love and affection,0

i 'm really kinda done now i have never felt this oddly calm when contemplating suicide before it 's always been a very emotionally turbulent thing i do n't know whether i 'm just desensitised to it or if it 's because it 's become a logical option now instead of one connected to emotion like it wa before i have been like this before with other thing this is how i felt when i first started self harming for example and i do n't know if i should be worried about that but either way i 'm not everything just seems to be building up and all my energy go into looking after other people and right now i 'm just too drained to care i guess i 'm taking these note in a very casual manner and if this go away i suppose that will scare me into asking for help again even if it did absolutely nothing last time anywho i 'm rambling just wanted to get this off my chest,1

up and down i 'm and i 'm selfish this is n't my first time considering suicide i 've thought about it many time before but i 've noticed a pattern in my life thing always seem to go well for a couple month and then something in the universe ha to kick me back down again it feel like an endless loop of happiness and satisfaction straight to a downward spiral of depression and anxiety but every time i go down it feel worse recently i 've lost my job a it wa in sale and it wa a performance based job and i could n't keep my number up now i should also mention that i used to be an avid pot head my personal opinion is it 's better than alcohol however that point is neither here or there but now i ca n't find a job i could go in and find some position that doe n't require drug testing but i 'm already miserable with my thought alone and i 'd rather not be miserable doing my job i understand it 's me being picky but regardless i have some standard but often those standard seem impossible to meet maybe i can see more negative thing when i 'm depressed but it seems like life ha to kick me when i 'm down car now need fixed i need rent money but ca n't find a good enough job and it 's all falling on me because there 's no one to blame but myself here 's one of the big reason i 'm selfish i grew up in a very strict catholic household however for about year i 've been an athiest meaning i do n't believe in any after life so when i die i 'm dead which make suicide a hell of a lot easier to consider once i 'm dead i wo n't have a guilty conscience of leaving anyone behind and honestly it seems like the more i think about suicide the more enticing it sound i know it would tear my family apart if i were gone but then again here i am thinking to myself that it wo n't matter to me because i wo n't have any consciousness so i end up asking myself almost every day am i ready and i feel like i get a little bit closer to saying yes every time,1

lonely little boy i am a child of fortune the son of a doctor and a registered nurse i have been given everything you could want in life i wa loved a a child my parent divorced there wa some strife but nothing so damaging to ruin a childhood but i can not remember being happy for very long in college i have been on paper a success good grade favorable impression on my professor a reasonable number of extracurriculars i in fact have a recurrent drinking and drug problem that ha been interfering with my schooling since second year and often fail to accomplish half the reading for a particular course coasting through on low standard and good essay i am in my final year of college writing a college thesis on child sexual abuse the first day i began researching the topic i wa somewhat upset by the content now the topic mean almost nothing to me i do not feel human reading this material instead like some sort of lizard crawling over and through a corpse looking for useful scrap everything i read about these horrible people seems increasingly to me like something i could become i have absolutely no desire to molest child or rape adult or anything of that sort but i am paralyzed by this idea that i could hurt someone i feel like my every move is a mistake slowly taking me down a path to irreparable damage to other people 's life that i can only solve by ending my own or making radical change e.g. telling everyone i know of the possibility that i could hurt someone stopping all drink and drug use isolating myself from society that i have no desire to make i can not honestly say i feel like a burden on others or that i 've been neglected or treated wrong or anything else i feel i have gotten everything a person can expect yet i feel numb i hate myself everything i do seems fake i look at the world and it is a though i am constantly kept from touching the surface nothing matter to me i have tried cutting myself and cutting off contact with friend but eventually the pain get to me and i return yet the understanding that something important wa lost hence the return doe not stay i type this now a though i am aware but i am not aware i still feel so horribly distant from everything i have ever done every person i have ever been and every friend i have ever known every word i say i recognize a a lie and desire to retract therapy is thus like cutting my stomach again and again only to be told that the gut inside me were someone else 's and to try again cutting deeper this time a the viscera begin piling up in front of me eventually obscuring the sight of the therapist a mass of gore this metaphor is labored which is exactly how i think in tired cliche the panting halting breath of a sick dog it all come so slowly to me i have trouble staying awake through a full day so many live with so little i hope there is rebirth somehow so i can join them no matter how much i give away it can not erase that i have given society none of my effort and that i have no talent to offer the fact that almost no sentence in this brief doe not predicate on i is confirmation of my own narcissism reading this you may think i have no friend or family but i do they just mean so little to me i neglect to mention them their effort to keep me alive can not even receive notice in this lament i feel like a spoiled child cry for pudding a a steak sizzle in front of them i want to be hung a an example i dream of maggot eating me and awake both scared and satisfied what the hell is wrong with me am i alone,1
my step-dad i decided to share my dad s story here in the hope that maybe someone might take comfort in it or that it might save someone s life somehow he wa actually my step-dad but wa in my life from the age of my dad suffered with emotional issue his entire life stemming from year of verbal abuse from his parent he wa told he wa stupid that he would never amount to anything his dad showed no interest in his life my dad played hockey a a teenager and his dad went to one game in all the year he played and it wa only because his co-worker s son wa playing on the other team in august my dad came out of his bedroom and collapsed in our kitchen we thought he wa having a stroke and called an ambulance he wa rushed to hospital and wa initially diagnosed with meningitis without any of the proper diagnostic test he returned home and remained sick for an entire month after his mental status began to deteriorate further and it seemed like he wa getting worse we took him back to the hospital and he wa re-admitted the day after we received a note in our mailbox that told u his bos had set him up to get sick in order to get him out of his workplace and had someone put pesticide and pill in his food in other word he wa poisoned he wa treated and recovered but noone wa every found guilty or charged following his poisoning he developed ptsd he saw his psychiatrist who diagnosed him one time and never again after that for the next two year he went to counselling and a psychologist stayed off work from his former workplace on stress leave and went to work somewhere else started going to the gym wa healthier and seemed happier little did we know his silent struggle underneath the happy facade he put on for u all january 29th my mom and i woke up around 9am i found a note on my bed that said i love you son my mom found one on her phone that said i ll love you forever his phone wa still on the counter his car wa in the driveway he left no note to say he wa going somewhere the little note he left u weren t alarming at first because he left note for u from time to time he hadn t let the dog out of his cage which wa unusual a he always did i let him outside and noticed our back door wa still locked we only ever used the back door he rarely used the front unless someone wa picking him up my mom called his best friend to find out if he wa with him he wasn t she checked his phone to see if there were any call or text that morning there weren t she found text between him and his counsellor he had cancelled all of his appointment in december and january lying about being sick and getting a full-time job my mom started to panic and decided to look at our security camera to see if someone picked him up she knew he had gotten up at 6:30am that morning a she had heard him rummaging in his dresser and had turned over to look at him before going back to sleep it wasn t unusual for him to get up early a he sometimes had trouble sleeping and would go for a walk or watch tv 6:38am he walked out the front door carrying a plastic grocery bag with something in it he walked out to the end of our driveway turned to look back at our house for a few second and then turned away and walked down the street my mom panicked and went to check his drawer all of his pill were gone 10:00am we immediately went to his parent s and grandparent s house they had two house on one lot his grandparent s are both deceased we knew that wa the only place he would go if he wa going to hurt himself he took the only set of key so we couldn t get into either house we didn t want to break a window a his parent are very crooked people and would likely have u charged with b e if we did and he wasn t there 10:30am we went to the police they didn t take u seriously had u go back home and wait for an officer to come to our house the officer showed up asked u question and told u to drive around and look for him while they looked at getting into the house 11:30am-12:30pm we drove around our little town we checked the cemetery where his grandparent are buried and checked some other place he might have gone called some of his friend etc. at his best friend called u and told u the police found him in his grandparent s house and to get there quickly a he wa unresponsive it wa the most terrifying thing we pulled up and my mom and i fell apart a we walked up to the house we were thinking he would be dead they wouldn t let u inside to see him they told u he wa breathing and that he would go straight to the city a he would need to go to a psychiatric unit after he recovered we started to head that way we hadn t even been driving minute and the police called my mom again and told u that his breathing wasn t stable enough and he needed to go to our local hospital first to be stabilized 1:30pm he arrived in the er and they started working on him he had overdosed intentionally he received dos of narcan and wa put on a narcan iv drip he had ingested multiple narcotic medication some of which were his from his hospitalization in some were his parent s from their house after hour he went up to icu they told u he needed to get the drug out of his system to stabilize and then he would go to psych he woke up periodically after a narcan dose wa administered he knew he wa in the hospital and tried sitting up to hug my mom he actually said hospital when asked if he knew where he wa 5:30pm my mom and i decided to go home to let the dog out and eat something we didn t even make it half way minute drive and the hospital called u back his breathing had deterioriated and they needed to intubate to maintain his airway we turned around and went back they intubated him it took three attempt and he vomited during the process aspirating into his lung 8:00pm my dad wa unstable and needed to be transferred to a better equipped hospital he wa transferred to one in the city for the next three or four day we were hopeful he showed sign up waking up when they lowered his sedative they told u once he recovered and could come off the ventilator he would go to psych and then we would deal with it from there that isn t what happened he wasn t able to be extubated the first week a he wa very agitated whenever they lowered the sedation the second week he started having seizure his et tube endotracheal tube that wa his life support started leaking and couldn t be changed for two day the hospital staff didn t listen to u when we kept saying he wa having seizure they told u it wa just shivering from his fever he had persistent fever after he aspirated because he developed aspiration pneumonia he went two day having untreated seizure on the 3rd day the doctor acknowledged his seizure but didn t prescribe any anti-convulsants he went two more day with no intervention on the 5th day the neurologist finally consulted and he wa put on anticonvulsant he ended up on three different medication on the 7th day he went for an mri and had a seizure for an hour and a half at this time he wa transferred to another hospital at the other hospital we were told he wa not being oxygenated properly they suspected a hypoxic brain injury at this point we had not seen him open his eye for almost two week they ran more test he developed infection they told u they couldn t tell how bad his brain damage wa unless they treated his infection but that he would need to have a tracheostomy put in a the et tube needed to be removed they are typically only used for week max he had his for at this point this wa where my mom had to make the hardest decision of her life where i ha to support her through it we were told if they did a tracheostomy that there wa no going back that he could recover but if he did have brain damage there would be no way of ending life support unless he required a feeding tube and we could stop that essentially starving him to death we decided to end life support a he would not want to recover if he could not go home who he wa before he had left note that were found with him in one he stated he wanted to donate his organ so we looked at organ donation in the end due to infection he wa only able to donate his kidney but in his death he did save two life the worst part of all of it wa the end they removed his life support and we all sat with him he needed to die within two hour to remain an elligible donor we sat there for two hour listening to the sound of him dying the sound of his breathing will haunt me for the rest of my life it is the worst thing that i have ever experienced and i am a nurse professionally i wish that experience upon noone at one point he opened his eye and i cried because i couldn t stand watching him suffer and struggle to breath knowing that the medication he wa receiving were making it harder for him it wa so upsetting to watch and with my mom by my side it wa that much harder watching her fall apart a the love of her life passed away we were listening to all of his favourite music while we waited he loved s hair band and for the last hour we listened to a random ozzy osbourne playlist on youtube he took his last breath right at the two hour mark when we thought all hope wa lost we didn t notice until later but the last song i had playing on my phone wa see you on the other side by ozzy osbourne he died halfway through the song february 24th the day we heard his last breath i am going to be burying his ash today two month later i ve been back to work i haven t started counselling yet but i know that i need to i have no sense of time my short term memory is all but gone even some of my long-term memory is gone right now but i remember each and every detail of the whole ordeal with crystal clarity my mom is staying off of work on stress leave while she deal with his affair i miss him so much i wish he would have come to me talked to me asked for help but all i can think about is how much he suffered he must have been in such terrible pain and while i love him and wish he wa still here i am happy for him that he is in a better place and is no longer suffering it s just a shame he wa so young at just year old i myself am only year old and i find it strange being so young and having to bury a parent to anyone having suicidal thought or who had attempted suicide know that i acknowledge your pain it is not all in your head it is not made up it is real and legitimate and you don t deserve to suffer that way i hope that our story may encourage you to seek help if only so that you don t risk suffering in the way that my dad did in the hospital for a month it s degrading and i know my dad would have been so angry and humiliated to have seen himself in that hospital bed unable to eat needing a catheter to urinate a rectal tube to prevent him from messing the bed all the time he would have been so infuriated with himself for putting himself in that position and knowing how he felt about u i think he would be angry with himself for putting my mom and i through all of it in the process but i don t blame him nor am i angry with him i still love him and i always will i do not wish any of this on anyone take care dad i miss you don t worry i ll take care of mom like you asked i love you more than you will ever know i only wish i had said it more often i love you,1

anyone else ever feel shaky after getting into online argument just today i got into an unpleasant interaction with someone in another subreddit on a different account i do n't want people looking for it and starting a brigade in short basically someone 's comment wa downvoted because they seemed to misunderstand the comment they were replying to i decided to reply to the downvoted person to explain why they were mistaken after a bit of back and forth they replied how about you just fuck off dude okay thanks i wa pretty taken aback because i never said any personal insult to them just an explanation of why they were wrong i replied saying that i apologize if anything i said came off a rude and then added i do n't have anything else to add so i 'll leave you alone now bye to which they responded i sure hope so obviously i did n't say anything to them after that ultimately i do n't have any reason to worry about this anymore and that person will probably forget about me by tomorrow but boy i still feel kind of tense about it now having a random person telling to you to fuck off online doe n't sound too terrible just ignore them right but it 's surprisingly uncomfortable when someone actually directs it at you personally i just realized now i get a sense of what it just feel like to be a well-known figure who ha much worse told to them regularly how have you reacted to experience like this before think i could 've handled it better got any story to share yourself,0

i am done i hate myself i am strongly considering taking my life tonight i will od on drug most likely or just go into the wood and starve to death sry for the long rant and lack of proper formatting i am basically lying in bed all day every day and rotting my life away for year now i have thought on my mind my mind is racing yet i am feeling dull and nothing affect me my whole life ha been a waste i feel like nothing is real nothing interest me nothing excites me i do n't have any life energy left inside of me i am not a person anymore just an empty shell devoid of any real life my heart and organ may function yet my brain constantly is fogged and poisoned with bad thought i have been alienating all my friend my family is broken and i have never had a girlfriend ever and i wont at this point it is impossible i am a short person at 172cm and my personality is a complete mess that is what year of being depressed can do to you i am such a different person to who i used to be i am deeply unhappy with every single cell of my being i wa always obsessed about my look going to the gym and watching my nutrition but for what i wa always unhappy in my own skin i could never satisfy my standard i always wished i wa someone else i wanted to live i just never wanted to live my own life nowadays i just do n't want to live no matter what i am a narcisst and i am my own worst enemy i dread every day i ca n't even watch movie or read or do anything i just stare at the wall and sleep wake up sleep again i have no dream left i am rapidly getting older i realize my best year have been all a waste i have nothing to look forward to i should have taken my life year ago already but i am a coward a well i dont want to live yet i dont want to die i just want to be dead without the process of having to die i have been fighting every day to somehow reach my goal of making at least a bit of money through different thing and then i lost almost all of my money the last week while i wa blackout drunk or maybe it got stolen i am year old and i am a complete mess at this point i am ashamed of myself so i will always tell lie about my life to people that do n't know me very well nothing ever go right i accept that i mean we are animal after all there is no guarantee of living a happy life or even a mediocre life i guess i wa stupid enough to somehow believe this hollywood good ending story shit growing up or that really bad stuff can somehow do n't affect me maybe a positive optimism but in my case it wa delusional i never worked on myself after it wa all too late i never got any help i always repressed everything i wa always too scared to to anything about my problem which were well-known to me at a younger age already however i just repressed and repressed and hoped everything would magically get better in some way or maybe i did n't hope it would get better and actually just didnt give a shit and with my passive agression against myself i wa constantly sabotaging myself to the point where i am at now i hated myself deep down even when i wa a kid i feel like i deserve this shitty life after all i guess at the same time weirdly enough i felt entitled to having a good or at least average life because growing up i never had to work in school to pas exam and even in university i never had to really work much to pas my exam i am disgusted by my own entitledness to be honest i am a twisted person i do n't even understand myself fully but i know i am a coward some people from poorer country would love to trade place with me i have a healthy body in a technologically advanced country i am reasonably intelligent i speak language but all of that doe n't matter when you are dead inside and dread living every day have nothing to look forward to and just want to be dead i am thinking about blasting steroid before i take my life but i dont know if someone could get into my exact situation it would take them maybe a year and they would have a decent apartment a driver 's license and all the thing i never had because i never managed to accomplish them i wa never assertive i guess i suffer from learned helplessness and feeling of powerlessness that 's why i am in the situation i am in today i guess that 's it maybe someone younger than myself can learn from this stupid rant and try to get help while it 's still possible,1

i wrote this a couple day ago only now got the courage to post it for a long time i ve been feeling this way it started when i first went to college the usual pressure and stress but i managed to get through it and complete all my course however i now know that this wa the start of it all it just kept bubbling away under the surface i pretty much buried it deep down i wa in a new job and needed to make a good impression could n't let anything get in the way of achieving my goal but then of course the stress of the job coupled with being away from home quite a lot for work i prefer being close to home where all my family are brought all those demon back to the surface i cant really describe the feeling for me it like an outer body experience standing behind myself and all i see is the husk of a broken man not really knowing what is wrong with me nor having any clue how to fix it day become a blur and no ability to sleep just lying awake night after night those bad thought get louder your useless a failure no one care about you why are you still even here and then just a i wa loosing all hope a ray of light appears my future wife appears really i cant tell you how we got together from my view it wa pure luck we started dating and then those thought start to subside not go away but they are a lot quieter then before i wa really starting to get to a happy place a place i have n't seen in a very long time and then we finally got married and went on honeymoon honestly the happiest month ive ever had but those demon never go away i recently got a promotion and it allowed me to be closer to home i should be over the moon but sadly not pressure of the new job i start making mistake not massive one easy to correct however the new people im working with are not the friendliest in the world i get berated every time i make a mistake and point out that this is happening because of a lack of training for my new position they are having none of it im told that i should be more then capable of doing the job and that no one would be made available to train me great maybe i wa right maybe i am useless worthless on top of this my new wife is trying to get me go look at a house to buy so we can start a family together more pressure is building and im just falling back to where i wa before scared for the future scared to be a father how can i bring a child into this world when im a mess im scared about buying a house and then maybe loosing it and becoming homeless very real fear for me when i wa younger my father lost his job and it took him a while to get another we almost lost our house and that brings me to today lost confused just about back to where i wa before i meet my wife i just don t know what to do,1

went on a hike today my dad 's old college buddy like to go on hike and he sends out mass invite to people about every other month to join him i always wa interested in going on a hike so back in november my dad asked me to tag along at it wa fun he did the same for today and it wa again fun and quite an adventure two other people who showed up last time excluding me my dad and his friend were there today a were three different people my dad 's friend and the one lady who showed up both time bring their dog along he owns a fat dachshund named ella and she owns a golden retriever named koby except for crossing a couple of water creek ella is able to do the entire hike by herself despite her size and stumpy leg koby run back and forth over and over and over and he often lay in puddles/water or roll around in dirt they make the hike so much more fun we actually got lost today somehow apparently this crew often cross from path to path instead of staying on the same one all the time cause they always go to the same park so it 'd get boring doing it that way and when we switched to one path even though we all thought there wa only one possible direction to go we went the wrong way we managed to find our way back and eventually got to the car the hike started at 10am and including a few short break and a far too long lunch break we finished at 6pm we apparently did around mile according to one of the guy 's hiking app a lot of it wa uphill but that 's not much of a problem i have n't run much at all the past few month so my cardio is kinda shit right now screw treadmill even though i 'm in the gym time a week so it wa a bit tiring at some point but i could have kept going for much longer i felt or at least without the break but since everyone else in the hiking group is somewhere between their mid-30s to late-50s not everyone wa a energetic a i wa my dad 's friend ha two bad knee and so when the painkiller wore off he really needed to rest more and more when i actually have free time when the semester end to get a life i would like sign up for hike using the meetup app so i could hopefully hike with people more around my age since i ca n't really find any of my own friend who 'd be interested because hiking definitely is a fun thing to do i love the outdoors do you ever do activity with your parent for fun or did you back when you lived at home if you do n't anymore what are your thought on hiking what 's the funniest thing you 've seen a dog do can you read map i 'm talking physical paper map here to find your way somewhere ^^^this ^^^is ^^^post ^^^out ^^^of ^^^360something ^^^with ^^^my ^^^goal ^^^to ^^^have ^^^a ^^^conversation ^^^on ^^^here ^^^every ^^^day ^^^of ^^^feel ^^^free ^^^to ^^^comment ^^^on ^^^anything ^^^i 've ^^^said ^^^answer ^^^my ^^^questions ^^^or ^^^just ^^^talk ^^^freely ^^^about ^^^yourself ^^^even ^^^if ^^^it ^^^does n't ^^^relate ^^^to ^^^the ^^^post ^^^i 'm ^^^here ^^^to ^^^chit ^^^chat ^^^it 's ^^^been ^^^days ^^^since ^^^i ^^^last ^^^missed ^^^a ^^^post ^^^^accidentally ^^^^hit ^^^^the make ^^^^font ^^^^smaller ^^^^thing ^^^^three ^^^^times ^^^^instead ^^^^of ^^^^two oops,0

i have a few depressed people around me and i would say the woman are very depressed anxious or panicky they take med but they still basically actively pursue men they sometime overthink it or get angry and cut it off quickly and so on but they actively use apps and even meet people when they leave the house they go to club and stuff when they can like they want to get out of the house and feel le depressed the guy i know are like full blown shut in who don t text unless texted first and even so rarely just don t leave the house unless it s for work maybe that s acute depression but my point is it seems like depression ruin everything for some people and some people function but somewhat sadly is being social impossible for some people,1

i 've never really opened up about this before and i feel like i need to tell someone i 'm female and an engineering student i 've been depressed and contemplated suicide for year but i never really talked about it to anyone i wa always afraid of what others would think of me if i did and even if they were supportive of me i did n't want to burden them by putting my problem on their plate i just need a place to vent out without feeling guilty about it back in high school i wa extremely anxious about the future because i never really felt prepared for the real world and doing thing on my own despite the fact that i mostly kept to myself since starting uni back in september everything ha just really spiraled down i wa n't doing well enough in class and i wa stressed to no end cue final week i did n't pas two of my class my childhood role model committed suicide and my boyfriend of year broke up with me saying that i wa too distant i felt like i wa kicked to the ground and i 've been barely crawling through life since i 've lost any motivation to go out and i 've lost passion for my major i 'm almost positive i 'm going to get kicked out of uni i have n't been keeping up with my friend and family and even the people i still talk to do n't know any of this i blatantly lie to them and i hate myself for doing it but at the same time i feel like they 'll just abandon me if they see how pathetic i am i especially ca n't face my parent back in seventh grade one of my best friend attempted suicide and my mother 's immediate response wa to tell me i should n't talk to people like her i 'm afraid of being shut out of my own family for how i feel and because i feel like i 've let them down people get along fine without me being around i 've never had much to add to the conversation in the first place even now that my boyfriend and i are back together he tell me about what he 's gotten accomplished in the three month we were separated and i even though he tell me that he missed me i can only think about how he wa more productive and how he managed just fine if not better without me i feel ashamed and selfish i do n't have a real reason to be depressed i 'm not poor i have an otherwise supportive family and my partner i made it into a great university so why do i feel like this why can i literally not imagine any future for myself i feel like i 'm worthless and i do n't deserve what 's been given to me in life the only thing that ha truly kept me from killing myself are my younger sibling they mean the world to me and the excited look on their face when i visit home make me feel guilty for wanting to leave and never come back they look up to me how could i ever want to leave them but at the same time it feel like it 's only gotten worse and worse ending it feel like the most realistic option for me i do n't know what to do,1

i do n't see it being discussed much it make me feel rather isolated i do n't think i even remember joy i only seem to recall fear and deep sadness i 've been depressed since i wa i suppose i wa genetically predisposed to it a it run on both side of the family a lengthy move across the pond and the bullying that went with being the new weird kid at school triggered it an inferiority complex due to a learning disability only made it spiral uncontrollably most people my age i 'm turning next month seem to be so excited about life but i only feel helpless i am exhausted at this point in life and feel like i can barely keep up with the ever so busy and growing world depression ha taken all interest and motivation away from me i have a rather vapid life with a personality to match i 'd be open to read your experience and feeling edit wow word can not describe how relieved and elated i feel to know that i am not alone all of you have dealt with such terrible experience i wish no one had to go through i wish all of you nothing but the best i am exhausted on all plane of existence but i will use what strength i have to carry on we must all move on,1
thing you do n't care anything about and would usually never talk about because you do n't care thing that shock you that anyone care about them for me it 's mostly popular stuff like sport minus sport entertainment car fashion music and pop culture ever have those thing you do n't care about so so so much that you essentially care too much about not caring it 's like you have animosity for something you swore you have no feeling about strange what do you totally not care about and might even be a little agitated about bringing it up because there is a chance it might come off that you care,0

i have had pretty bad anxiety and depression the only good time i had we with other people when we were relaxed every single time i try to trip alone i get sent into an anxious spiral and not good introspection if you already feel trepidation that you need to change something in your life you will feel that x1000 sometimes thats what you need to get the message through i very much wish i could trip like those good time but in my daily life i havnt made the change i need to and so i know going it alone again is only going to lead to difficult time a a non drug alternative i say go outside to the most pristine bit of nature in your area meditate and ponder the mystery of existence how/why do we have this sense of awareness/consciousness in the first place,0

i did n't know where or who else to talk to this about so i 've come here i 've accepted i wa in a dark place and that i had to get out that i would get out but now i feel a if i am only prolonging the internal counting down of my inevitable suicide i feel a if this latest revelation i have made is now becoming apart of me a if this suicidal part of me is pushing everyone away including my better half to get a hold of my conscience so that when a day that every little thing hit with the force of a bullet it will be waiting for me at the very back of my mind telling me to end it i know there is usually a light at the end of the tunnel but i cant find mine can someone lend me theirs,1

full disclosure opinion of an old fart with no relevant real world experience it seems that there is a reluctance to teach the essential of daily life of course those essential include personal finance social study art and world history hopefully those are covered some but the main thing that should be taught until it is at the forefront of every student 's analysis of everything is logical fallacy so much of the political discourse a well a people 's decision could be improved if everyone only understood how propaganda work but there is or seems to be a reluctance to analyze current event because doing so is controversial imagine if an english teacher went line by line dissecting a speech by the president of the u for logical fallacy sure within sentence the student would understand everything from ad populum to post hoc and be able to see through the propaganda but these day the parent would be up in arm arguing about how people are picking on their party or some garbage about loyalty or some such thing school should be a place to learn how to think analytically but it seems to be a place to learn how to avoid thinking at all at least if current political discourse is any indication,0

i have to believe that one day i will be rewarded for the good i have done/will do i have to believe that the hurt misfortune i go through ha a purpose.i have to believe these thing in order to make it to the next day.i have to believe that one day everything will be okay but will it i keep trying and trying and trying nothing is good enough i wake up each day and try so hard to be better i try to have a positive outlook on life i try to be the light in the life of others i always go out of my way to help someone or text them or do something to make them smile but it is never returned if i don t text someone first then we don t talk no one ever call or text or asks how i m doing because nobody care i ve put on this happiness facade for so so long that i think people just think i m always okay they think i could never feel so low that i cry myself to sleep or cut myself or contemplate just ending it all they don t know that my anxiety ha gotten so bad that i can t control my cry or panic attack s and those who do know do not care.i used to be able to remain silent when being yelled at or look past why wa being said now i can t even do that my instant reaction is to just break i ve bottled everything up for so fucking long that everything is the tip of the iceberg everything just pile on top of each other and i just let go by cry because when i do try to explain why i feel the way i do i m wrong i apologize for being upset with thing that are said or done to me but no one apologizes for saying or doing the thing in the first place i guess it s just so hard for me to understand how nobody look out for me because i am so empathetic with everyone and their feeling if i know you re going through something i will try to make your day easier by helping you out and taking some stress off your shoulder but when is it my turn when do i get to have someone genuinely care about how i m feeling when do i get my thought and emotion heard and understood instead of bottling them up or being to blame when i have always been in the shadow of those around me who have mental health issue and because of it i ve never gotten help because my issue aren t a bad i need help so badly i have considered putting myself into a mental health hospital but i could never afford that i have looked into going to a counselor but no one is ever open during the hour im available not like i could afford that either i need help i want to be better but it s so fucking hard when the people around me who have the resource to help themselves don t get help they don t realize how jealous i am i their opportunity they have the chance to get help they choose not to meanwhile i m struggling so bad wishing i could change i ve never felt so low in my life my anxiety ha never been so bad my self esteem is almost non existent because every time i like something it is put down or made fun of every time i don t think i can do it anymore,1

i actually think about this fairly often because it 's something that carry over into living in sharehouses when you 're one of many sibling you do n't expect to be able to take up all the space like i moved in with someone who thought it wa fine to spend all her time in the main living area watching what she wanted to watch on the tv cooking weird smelly thing and decorating how she wanted without any regard to oh no-but-wtf owns thing too that might need to go in this room it would never occur to me to do that if you 're sharing a living space with someone you can do that stuff half the time but there 's this innate understanding that some night you got ta leave the main space for the other person and some night you got ta let them have first go in the kitchen and when you first move in you ask so what bookshelves/etc do you have that we need to fit in here i often think i m not assertive enough about taking up space honestly i 'm pretty chill about this kind of thing because i grew up sharing everything all the time so only sharing with one person wa nice although i moved in on my own eventually and god it 's glorious to be able to put a book down on the table and know it 'll still be in exactly the same place tomorrow,0

i do n't want to accidentally kill myself i 've made this account to post here i 've never done it before i 've been dealing with off and on depression my whole life i 've been to therapy but never gotten a solid diagnosis for anything other than depression it used to just be complete sadness all the time however it 's not like that anymore i have fit or like moment of feeling like the scum of the earth sometimes lasting a day or more and sometimes le than an hour during this time i have almost killed myself twice when they 're over i feel completely fine and sometimes regret it i do n't want to do it if i 'm not completely sure i really do n't know what to do,1

i guess i 'm just curious how other people go through life feeling emotional my whole life i have been very emotional i had my first girlfriend leave me because i always wanted to be by her side now i know that being clingy is not good and i lost her because of it i learned how to stop that now that i 'm older i 'm the type of person who dream every night of finding someone who i can share all my thought with being able to just sit next to a person i love would make me happy i would want thing to be simple every time i 'm around guy that talk about how some girl that walked by is hot make me feel sick i cant imagine what it would be like to be a person like that maybe it rock given you do n't need to feel emotion because truthfully being like this make me depressed i would never want to be anybody else but me though no matter how bad it get now i 'm and have a girlfriend again i respect her a lot i fell for her because she is a very nice person she is a very simple too when i 'm with her i do n't have any sexual thought like most guy would i truly enjoy just being in her presence it all started off very good until i started showing my emotional side i feel like each day that go by she push herself further away from me now that i know that doe n't really have a future my mind began to protect itself for impact lol i keep trying to convince myself that i do n't need her there is something better out there make me feel very depressed most day what make me upset is that lately i feel like girl lie more than men do sometimes i think they are more ruthless and mean than men maybe i just seen the worst of them lol men are always told that they do n't have emotion but i feel like i have way more true emotion than girl do i feel like any girl i will find will just get turned off by my emotional side i 've never been a very good writer so it is very hard for me to explain how much emotion i actually feel so i will try to summarize it all i feel like without someone i will never be whole i value relationship more than anything in my life for me it relationship first than career etc i prefer romantic movie lol i 'm a big dreamer ill go many night of just building beautiful story in my head i would never be able to have a one night stand or get with somebody i do n't truly fall in love with or else i would cry and hate myself forever i believe in a true connection with someone it doe not need to be a fantasy story just a real connection one that make you whole where it just you and the other person no worry of cheating i 'm always scared of a girl cheating on me that should be a fear that girl think about there is so much that i have no clue how to word it all i 'm always living in a huge ocean of emotion,1

i have friend but i also don t have friend i m a friendly guy and sociable enough to make handful of friend but i don t know why even though we got so much in common i feel they only recognize me a a hi-bye friend i m close to them but not close enough to be in their boundary it s like i m not the friend that s okay enough to be asked to go out and so i am alone every time i see an instagram story of my friend eating on happening place or just taking fresh air while casually strolling downtown my heart just ache it s not that i hate them for not inviting me it s their choice it s because i don t have any group of friend that i can invite or be invited to do something like that every friend that is close enough to me have their own group of friend to have fun every weekend and i surely shouldn t barge in to theirs deep down i need something like those some happiness to clear my mind off from college but i don t have that kind of friend and that kind of friend probably doesn t even consider me a the people they should invite for these kind of stuff,1

had some good job interview yesterday i had my second interview with a company and for a role that i 'm really interested in it wa a harder interview but i think i hit all the key point and represented myself well so if they choose not to move forward then at least i 'll know it 's because they want someone with more experience than me and that 's fine i 'll hopefully hear back from the recruiter on next step by the end of the week but it feel nice when you can do an interview well and feel okay with the result it 's a privileged position that i know a lot of people do n't have the luxury of appreciating but it doe feel quite nice just wanted to share feeling hopeful about the future today,0
diagnosis anxiety depression autism spectrum disorder x200b so i 've been on antidepressant for around five year now it 's been a bumpy ride and i 've had to switch med several time i 'll give a basic timeline of the med i 'm on and what happened x200b prozac this did n't work at all i wa depressed anxious and highly volatile i would have severe outburst of rage and would have time where i hated myself and wished i wa dead on a routine basis prozac and abilify my doc thought adding a mood stabilizer would help did n't work i wa still unstable and my only interest wa sleeping because it wa so sedating that i literally could n't live whatever excuse for a life i had at the time i wa either dosing off in class or looking for a place to nap during my off period prozac and seroquel this sucked it wa n't effective enough and the withdrawal symptom were aggravating also i wa still dealing with bout of aggression my anxiety wa so bad that i wa having hand tremor at the time people occaisonally would ask me if i had parkinson zoloft and seroquel this wa slightly more effective than zoloft though not by much i had a suppressed sex drive and i would think about castrating myself because of how much of a loser i felt like effexor i tapered off the previous med and started taking effexxor instead thinking an snri would be more effective this wa n't enough and it certainly did not help with my sexual dysfunction mirtazapine/remeron this one actually worked pretty well once i raised it to the maximum dose of 45mg i wa on it for about year still am only problem is it seems to be insufficiently effective a of the last month with my depression getting progressively worse over the last month i can barely function now having depressive episode where i begin to exhibit unbearable level of pain and psychotic thought for hour on end anyhow given my history of medication and that mirtazapine seemed to be the most effective what would you suggest i switch to or ask my psychiatrist about x200b,1

not to settle no matter how much other area of the person may seem to overshadow any shortcoming meaning if you really love big boob but you end up hitting it off with a girl who ha an a-cup but a beautiful face and great personality maybe check yourself think hard about if you wan na pursue that long term because the honeymoon phase will pas and you may find yourself missing tit and that lead to relationship issue like regret resentment cheating porn addiction etc none of that is good for either of you this of course applies to much more than just tit like maybe they are gorgeous but share no mutual interest or maybe you have a shit ton in common and get along perfectly but you just arent super turned on by them physically know exactly what you want and pursue that settle for nothing le,0

i wa diagnosed with depression in fast forward year after counselling and a few different med i decided to quit those med life since then ha had it ups and down but it in a round about way ha been hugely positive but today and for the last few month ive had this overwhelming feeling just to walk away from it all i 'm fighting the self destruction i had felt back in i 'm tired my brain never switch off at work i worry about home at home i worry work i constantly moan but feel trapped i try hard to find positive every day but dwell on the negative i constantly put on a front to try to appear happy though it 's getting more difficult to do i just want to walk into the sunset and dissappear,1
like if you can get the card game from witcher a a standalone app you ca n't it took me hour of searching to work that out yet tomorrow i 'll want to try and motivate myself to do just an hour 's seo work or a short jog and some hand weight and my motivation just deflates at the thought of all that effort it 's one of the stupidest trap that you ca n't do shit if it is at all important and yet if it is n't important you do n't want to 'waste your time on it and you end up doing fuck all anyway e to clarify it 's not simply procrastination it 's a weird glitch in my motivation where my brain anticipates an activity that will probably only take minute to an hour but write it off due to feeling i wo n't have enough energy/time to do it successfully so it 'd be a waste of time but instead of doing something productive instead i 'll then actually waste the time that it would have taken me to do the thing by just checking my phone or whatever and yet i do not encounter the same motivational 'lock when picking up my phone to type a reddit post or experiment with settlement layout in fallout inconsequential activity that are actually wasting my time seem to slip past the 'waste of time demotivator at least until i 've spent way too long on them and then feel bad i do n't know if i 'm explaining this right it 's just a weird logic glitch i 've been thinking about you know instead of working,1
all you 'car people how do you do it i 'm just now starting down the road of working on my first hobby car and it seems like every answer is n't just year/make/model plug-and-play but also a maze of different interchangeable part that only seems navigable by wizardry sorted by a numbering system that itself requires a certain expertise to understand not to mention the random assortment of 'tips that you can only stumble across by that guy on a forum somewhere where if you 're going to do x you might a well do y but you 'll have to completely remove z to get at either of them also watch out for a or b in the process is this honestly why people join car club because collectively you rely on a hive mind of knowledge with how fluctuating answer can be,0

need some advice in a difficult situation i 've got a close friend who is apparently contemplating suicide they 're not threatening to do it right now she 's saying she 's going to do it later this week because she 's not in her right mind the thing is she 's in a rough spot and we 're afraid she might change her mind at any time some background she 's my partner 's closest friend but about a year ago her boyfriend which is underselling it they 'd been together almost year began to become really abusive he got so bad that one time he came over to our house while she wa here and threatened to kill my partner then punched the glass out of our door the next time she came over he showed up in the morning and i had to run him off with an expandable baton then a he wa leaving my upstairs neighbor came out to see what wa going and he pulled a knife then threatened to kill her and her grand-daughter but she stuck with him well his health wa deteriorating in fact during that last confrontation he actually left his colostomy bag on our porch well he died a couple of day ago she 's devastated because he wa doing his best to isolate her from everyone she 's pretty much alone and she want to stay that way she doe n't answer the phone and only a small number of people even have her number she 's gone dark on social medium a well she 's corresponding with my partner through text message though and a few people have been able to get in touch with her she 's been presenting a coping pretty well to them but we are seeing a different side of her she 's been very adamant that she doe n't want to leave the apartment they lived in and she 's been pretty clear that she doe n't want anyone to come over there either some of the people who have gone have had to end up leaving the thing they brought for her outside the door she say that she 's only telling u how she really feel because she trust u not to call police that kind of thing we 're thinking of just going over there regardless but at the same time we 're pretty much the only people she trust if we do something to betray that trust and the outcome is not something that resolve her suicidal tendency then we may have just cut her only lifeline in this state nc with the kind of money that we myself partner and the subject of this post have which is basically none we do n't trust the police et al to solve this issue if the only thing on the line were our relationship with her i would n't hesitate for an instant if i thought that she had someone else that she would contact if we burned this bridge i would n't be posting when it come to these thing i 've lost too many friend to not take action but we 're trapped if we go we risk alienating her and it 's likely she wo n't have anyone to talk to in the future about this kind of thing if we call for assistance or really tell anyone about this the same issue exists if we respect her wish we have to continue texting with her and hoping that the text keep coming and when they do n't we have good reason to think that maybe it 's because there will never be any more of them any help is greatly appreciated thank you in advance and thank you for helping all of the people like myself who come here,1

welcome to the ir regular check-in post a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing if you have an accomplishment you want to talk about these should n't be standalone post in the sub a they violate the role model rule but are welcome here or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post this is a place you can share we try our best to keep this space a safe and supportive a possible on reddit 's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform the community rule can be found in the sidebar if you are n't sure about a rule please ask u if you have concern or question about the community policy this is a good place to raise those a well this time i want to share some point about helping ops who may be at risk for suicide although we understand that depression and suicidality are distinct issue and we encourage people whose main issue is suicidal thought and feeling to post at /r/suicidewatch we do n't feel that any kind of you should post there not here message could conceivably be helpful to a person in great distress however the information in the sw sidebar /r/suicidewatch/about/sidebar may be of help to anyone trying to support someone struggling with thought of suicide we link the two most important post for helper the talking tip and risk assessment guide from the sidebar here but there 's a lot more there almost nobody post about their suicidal thought on reddit because they do n't know that hotlines exist just providing a hotline number without finding out how the person might feel about that option can make the person feel invalidated also if it doe make sense to suggest a hotline in a particular case do n't just assume a person 's in the u imagine the how it would feel for a u redditor to be told just call that 'll work everywhere meaning everywhere in the european union there 's a global directory in the /r/suicidewatch sidebar which is also linked here and that 's the best link to offer someone whose location you do n't know remember that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention that save far more life than it cost the situation where breaching someone 's confidentiality is the best option are the outlier like when someone is strangled by a safety harness plus we almost never have enough risk assessment information to justify outing someone which ha to go through reddit 's admins and their legal team and subjecting them to a traumatic invasive involuntary intervention which may discourage them from opening up about their feeling in future if you do feel that a post need attention from the mod team for any reason including high risk of harm please take a few extra second to send u a modmail rather than clicking report the linkage between report and spam is hardcoded into reddit 's dna so clicking report on a post increase the risk that the post will be snagged by the sitewide filter which we have no control over keep in mind that the most reliable way to de-escalate someone is to give them the experience of feeling understood a strong interpersonal connection is usually enough to reduce immediate risk of suicide that 's one of the many reason why this little empathy video http //www.youtube.com/watch v=1evwgu369jw is always linked from our sidebar,1

why i ca n't break up with my depressed girlfriend hello i have been with my girlfriend for almost year now the whole relationship i have felt i want to break up with her but i have n't been able to there is a lot of reason why i can tell you some before we started our relationship i wanted to just have sex with her we were like friend with benefit then she started to want to have relationship with me but i did n't want because i just got out of a relationship and wanted to be alone one day she cut herself and wa suicidal and told me that she doe n't have reason to live i thought i can save her from this and i told her that we can start an relationship i did not want a relationship but i went in because i wanted her to be happy then couple month passed thing were pretty great for first couple month we had a lot of fun then we got some of our first argument and she cut herself again she said because she felt shes worst girlfriend in the world because shes so needy and ugly etc then the relationship became pretty manipulative she once hit me drunk because i did not want to have sex with her she is of course very sorry about her behaviour and even cutted herself again because she felt so bad person after doing that i think we are codependant with each other i feel depressed and no-motivation when not being with her though shes abusive sometimes when i am with her and she ha everything allright i feel so good like if shes happy i feel happy i feel like it my life job to keep her from negative thought also i do n't know is it weird we talk to each other like people talk to dog and baby in cute voice i feel like shes my baby i allways want to hold her thight and hug her when i hang out with her good trait is that she is very caring and pay for everything for me she even bought playstation for me to her place so i would spend more time at her place and when we still had sex she did every my fantasy i could think of she is my almost only friend too we do everything together go play soccer and ice-skating swimming etc and those day i really feel good she also cared for me day when i wa sick came to my place and took couple day off work because she felt like i wa the most important thing though then she got sick couple month later and have been accusing me that i did not do the same thing i feel like shes dream girlfriend but not for me now with her abusive behaviour i once called cop when she wa in apathethic suicidal very scary state i got her in therapy for some time doing that and she took ssri drug because i told her that i will leave her if she doe not try to get better she stopped using those couple month back she ha borderline diagnosis i know i am in abusive relationship or atleast have been i think she ha been not-abusive for couple of month now she still tell me a lot that shes not getting enough sex not enough attention and stuff and that is true i rarely see her couple time a week anymore i make excuse why i ca n't see her because i have become anxious of faking my feeling and i know i am about to explode soon i have n't given her single clue about that i am thinking about to leaving her i live in constant fake feeling with her i think about breaking up with her like time a day i think about other girl i think about going on vacation with my buddy without her bringing me down but there a lot of reason why i am not able to do it and i really think that i ca n't one reason i have delayed this is that i allways think this is not the proper time to do it i wa graduating from school i ca n't put up with the stress and depression now and fail everything i wa in my first job i ca n't put up with the stress she moved to new house i ca n't put up with the stress now on her i got new job i ca n't put up with the stress now she got a job i ca n't put the stress now on her my step-father wa diagnosed with cancer i ca n't put up with the stress now also i am diagnosed with ocd bad obsessive thought harm-ocd schiz-ocd you name it depression anxiety disorder and depersonalization which wa so bad at one time i wa becoming suicidal too when i got with her i forgot about all my ocds she assured me that i am okay and that i wo n't kill anybody my obsessive ocd thought that i could'nt hurt a butterfly read about harm-ocd if you do n't know i thought i wa going to kill my whole family still get it sometimes and that i allways helped me to assure that i am totally sane that i am not going schizophrenic read about schiz-ocd if you dont know she wa allways there for me when my depersonalization became worse holded me in her arm she is allways there for me now when i leave her i am going to lose human being who i wa able to tell all my darkest thing i am going to get panic attack and there is no one who is to calm me down i am going to get my schiz-ocd think i am going insane and no one is there tell me that i am okay calm me down and totally sane it just my ocd talking one reason is that she is also depressed and suicidal sometimes and i am her only one too who she can tell everything i am there to calm her down she ha threatened to kill herself once if i leave her that she ca n't do it on her own and told it in very scary calming voice too like she could really do it if she really would kill herself because of the break up i would have to live that for rest of my life with my own mental issue too it too much though it is so hard i have decided to try to break up with her one month from now once for all this is where i would like some advice how to make it better for me and her surviving it one of the biggest problem here is my feeling of guiltiness and pity i feel guilty and bad conscience i always feel like it i know that i am not responsible of her happiness but i feel like i am horrible person not to make so lovely person happy i would feel so guilty to leave her she ha told me that she can t live without me and that i make her life complete and that i am the one for her i feel so much pity towards her her parent and her friend do not care about her they ve all ditched her she is one of the greatest person i know and care so much if i could wish one thing from a magic lamp it would be her to be happy and get over her mental issue and be happy without me how i can shake this feeling of guiltiness it eating me alive to feel so guilty and depressed all the time about this i have had seen so many emotional breakdown from her i know how it is going to probably go here s example of her borderline seizure/panic attack whatever she get upset about something i say or do it is like being in a haunted house first she become apathetic and will not answer to anything i say then she will start shaking in bed and breathing very fast ask me for to leave and let her go probably meaning me to leave so she can cut herself i try to calm her down by holding her and then she will punch me away from her then she will start cry and shaking together then her breath come normal and she go back to the apathetic mode and is all blank want to kill herself she will begin talking and blame me for her feeling of depression until it go to the part i am starting to leave because i can t take it no more when i step out of the door she will start to realize what she ha done and apologizes and is cry and begging me to stay with her and then rest of the night she will try everything to make it out for me for blaming me i am myself little manipulative because the part i am leaving in that episode i am just doing it to get her to apologize to me and treat me better i could not really leave there since i don t want her to hurt herself and i can easily always forgive her blaming on me because i think it is because of her borderline and she ha no control over it and she is always very sorry and caring after those thing we have had fight and every time i have wanted to leave from her and go home she would physically grab me and not let go tell me that she will kill herself if i will go so i feel like it is not physically possible to leave her but i can t even get to that part because i am so emotionally unstable and codependent on her too that i will burst in to tear and beg her to stay with me i will feel like it wa the worst mistake of my life for couple of day then i will again feel like i want to break up i really need help how to break up with her in this part is where in need the advice i have decided to really now do it i took one week away from work like day from now and keep all of this inside me until then so i can focus on it and recovering first i wa thinking i maybe should write her letter why i want to break up with her and go to her place and hand it to her then she will have emotional breakdown and become suicidal i know it can i just leave her and drive away then or do i have to comfort her if i leave her she will really physically grab me and not let me go i have been there before with her if i just force myself out of there is it wrong thing to do and then if shes really suicidal should i tell it to her friend and sister her parent hate her they are alcoholic maybe i should call the cop to check on her what if she doe not let me go and is all out of control how i can leave her alone i do n't really know anymore what is wrong and what is right this relationship and manipulation is making me go nut am i doing the wrong thing causing someone to suicide i am really going insane about this you probably can see it from my writing the worst thing is no one ha clue about this and think we are perfect couple i have been therapist about this and he said that i should stay with her never gone again tomorrow i will probably see her and she will be perfect and i do n't want to break up with her anymore i am so mindfucked please give me some advice i dont want anymore to do thing i dont want i do thing that make her feel good i feel bad help,1

lost the only source of joy in my life yesterday last night i wa kicked from the community orchestra i 've been a part of since september last year the entire duration of my time with them i carpooled with a girl and we became good friend last weekend we had a huge performance at a convention the night of friday after a long day of con and a rehearsal that went until 11pm i opened up to her about my frustration in life she seemed to empathize and then under the context of another topic it came out that she had broken up with her boyfriend week ago up to this point i had firmly respected her boundary to remain just friend but immediately after this revelation i found myself considering the idea of asking her out i 'm only human on sunday i wa prepared to give her a plushie of her favorite pokemon and ask her out after our performance before i could she wa informed that her friend had managed to get her a job interview that same day so i kept quiet so a not to add to the thing on her mind the next day i sent her a couple fb msg asking to meet up no response i wa prepared to write it off a her being busy but then she started talking in the orchestra 's group chat while the sign next to my message remained delivered but not read clearly she wa ghosting me and i am still bewildered a to why we had a great time at the con sure i may have been the stereotypical nice guy for driving her around but i always made her laugh with joke and kept the social awkwardness to a minimum with the rest of the group so the next day tue after still no response i assumed she wa upset with me and asked one of her friend if she knew why well the friend wa unhelpful but must have prompted carpool girl to respond because she did trying to reassure me that nothing wa wrong problem wa i could sense passive aggressiveness in her writing which stuck out immediately because she had always been polite if not sweet with me i tried to call her out on it because it seemed at the time that 's what a self-respecting man should do well now i know i should have let her have her space or just gave up on her on wed she actually had a brief exchange with me i tried to make my worry about her known in a humorous way but probably came across resentful i think the situation might still have been salvaged at this point with me retaining my place in the orchestra if not repairing my relationship with carpool girl well i threw it all away last night my friend who recently landed a job invited me out for drink to celebrate he knew i wa feeling down too what a great guy well i got way more drunk than i 've ever been and sent a few pitiful text when i got home our conductor had messaged me on fb warning me that she had received complaint of harassment normally i would have probably taken a step back and reined myself in well drunk me decided sending a few nasty message accusing carpool girl wa the right course of action and almost immediately conductor replied back that that constituted repeat offense so i wa out of the group anyway thanks to anyone who read this far it is already helping with my thought to have my side of the story out even if you 're complete stranger god know how they are maligning my name at this very moment certainly i 'm not innocent but i just know there 's no one in the group who feel a shred of sympathy for me i had been having near constant dark thought today and i feel like the painful reality wo n't even set in until the day of their next rehearsal fuck i 'm so mad at myself,1

i want to kill myself i m in a relationship with someone who i don t deserve we recently went on vacation together and on a couple of the night i became super moody and depressed she told me she still enjoyed the vacation after i apologized but i know she s lying to spare my feeling because she know i m sporadically suicidal i ruined a vacation she needed after working a couple of hour week because i m a selfish piece of shit i need to end it all to get her out of this so she can be with someone else who is competent at life twist i m way too much of a coward to actually do it now even though it s time i can t picture my poor mom having to go through this once my parent are dead i ve made a promise to myself to kill myself no matter what to atone for my past deed like this can t wait,1

so much pain i really wish it wa legal for me to get medical assistance with dying life just seems to be getting worse and i have increasingly le energy to continue surviving i 'm a trans woman in my 30 since my earliest memory i knew there wa something wrong but thought it wa ridiculous that i wanted to not be a boy every day i would get reminded that i wa a boy that i would grow up to be a man and that anything else wa inconceivable i wa told that i had to learn to perform masculinity and being the people pleaser i am i did my best with that when puberty hit my world crumbled my voice started deepening i grew facial/body hair and i started looking more and more like the man i never wanted to be i also realized i wa attracted to men probably because transitioning still seemed like science fiction to me at the time i came out a gay i endured a lot of bullying and hate when i came out in high school but hey that wa the early 2000s at age i finally came to term with the fact that i wa n't a gay man i hated being male even a gender non-conforming one and started realizing that transition wa actually a possibility for many people i came out a second time a a trans woman found acceptance in my family started hormone changed all my paper started gradually being gendered a female met a straight guy who happened to find me attractive and even underwent bottom genital surgery by all account it would seem i 'm a trans success story but that is wrong i have been spiralling down into this bottomless pit of depression and anxiety although pre-transition my maleness brought me so much pain now that i 've completed transition i feel so much more dysphoria knowing that i 've done most of what i can and still see a man in the mirror whenever i 'm out in public i have a constant fear of being 'clocked found out a trans and it 's gotten so bad that i never leave the house i experienced a lot of violence and harassment early in my transition and every time anyone so much a look at me for longer than second i start panicking thinking my life is probably going to be in danger again yes i pas in the sense that no one including completely stranger ha referred to me a a man in a year and a half but i know that the majority of people can probably 'tell after taking a closer look at me at i 'm also a really easy target for harassment so people are completely uninhibited in laughing or snickering at me at best i 've transitioned to a very odd-looking masculine androgynous woman i wish i could undo everything but a i 've built this life around my female identity including a relationship with a man and his family i 'm not even sure i deserve and b i keep remembering how awful my dysphoria wa pre-transition too no matter what i do to my body or what i call myself there i am a person with crippling dysphoria who is unable to escape from their pain i so wish i could end everything right this second i ca n't help but feel this life wa not meant for me to be in,1

settling other planet ok so let 's assume we 're the only intelligent being in the universe even though that 's statistically improbable if we settle on other planet the people living there will evolve to suite the need of that planet maybe theyll have senser bone such a people living on mar so they can walk naturally on the surface and some will have incredibly thick skin and strong muscle to withstand the pressure of venus my point is that even if we are the only one now through evolution the human race will evolve into a hundred different specie within the next billion year so in theory we will have created a new form of alien of course the faster version of this would be terraforming and even then the planet may not be perfect meaning that the people of one planet will be different the the people 's of the other it 's at this point we have to ask if we are all human or are we different specie all together will there be new form of discrimination i feel show like the expanse do a great job at showing these difference,0
i have very few friend and even then i m not really close to them it s very hard for me to make friend and even harder to open up to them i know they have plenty of other friend they re much closer to and it wouldn t really make much of a difference if i disappeared meanwhile if they disappeared from my life i would pretty much have no one i just wish i really mattered to someone,1
i dont know what to do im horrible at this type of thing ive been in a strange situation in life these past few month ive been suicidal/depressed since and over the past year ive gotten so much better but ever since august ive completely fallen apart and suicide is the only option i see a a solution,1
i do n't know why i am doing this i just feel like i need to externalize how i 'm feeling rn and i 've got no one to talk to about it so ig this is the right place i do n't know how to start lmao i feel so awkward rn a i 'm typing this i guess i 'll start off surface level so i tend to be more happy or at least i try to think so than sad or apathetic but sometimes i just feel really down on thinking about certain thing like the future i wish i could go back and be a kid forever a time where stress anxiety and paranoia were nonexistent sometimes i 'll be in a great mood but then the last half of the day will just be horrible and not horrible in that a disaster happened but i just get extremely bored sometimes i 'll sit behind my desk staring at my monitor for over minute not doing anything just moving the cursor over my homescreen constantly sometimes it 'll be vice versa i 'll be really apathetic the first half of the day and then slowly over time i 'll get really energetic and feel motivated i do n't really know how to describe it it 's not quite motivation but something like it a feeling of needing to do something i guess but not in a forced way i really dont know how to explain it lol what 's really weird is that i beat myself up over it when i 'm in this mood first i wan na preface this by saying that i 'm a straight up narcissist and i have no shame about it i love being prideful but that make my situation weirder because i do n't know if this is normal but i make myself cry or feel horrible when i 'm sitting down being bored or energetic i psychologically just berate myself sometimes i do n't know why i swear i love myself a lot and this is completely out of character but i just make myself cry sometimes i force myself to cry and not even through physical pain one time in particular i felt happy first i guess i should say i always daydream i always think of myself in different world universe scenario etc not necessarily good one it 's the only way i get to use my creativity for some reason i 'm not articulate in art or music or whatever but i have vivid imagination and the only use of it i can make is in my own mind anyways one time i wa having the best daydream of my life i do n't remember what it wa exactly but i felt genuine happiness instead of the usual pseudo-joy i get from the petty escape that videogames/videos/movies bring me however i felt something like primal arise from inside me again i do n't know how to describe this feeling but i felt uncomfortable all of the sudden after what wa probably about minute i started whispering to myself i started saying it 's not real for a couple second a while after that i had my hand squeezing my head a hard i could i felt my nail trying to break into the skin of my scalp at this point i wa cry profusely and saying thing like go away it all fake you are alone i want to be alone what are you doing here get out of my head anything along those line the thing that freak me out the most looking back on this event is that i wa saying this all on my own will it wa n't like i wa a third party observer watching my insane body act on it own i wa in full control and in way even forcing myself to say and do these thing even though i wa fully aware there wa no one there nor had i perceived anyone there with me in that room i begged to be left alone for some reason to this day i ca n't pinpoint why or who or what i begged to leave me alone i wa alone my parent werent home it wa just me and my computer and i 'm not schizophrenic or at least i 've never been a diagnosed but even if i did have it at that moment it would have been obvious but it wasnt a hallucination the closest thing i have to hallucination is the occasional ringing in both my ear but that probably because i 'm lacking some sort of vitamin or whatever can cause ringing in ear eventually my begging turned into incoherent whimper i do n't know why i did it or if i even wanted to but i swear it wa all on my volition i wa there i know i wa and i wa doing everything i wa the one behind the control when i cried when i begged to be left alone when i started to bang my head against the wall i even started to punch and hit myself on my head all while pleading get out of my head you do n't exist i want to be alone it wa so surreal because i know i 'm not this type of person again i can be a terrible narcissist that is cold and calculated it 's eerie how irrational i wa in that moment after more of self-hitting i limped into the kitchen i dragged my hand up to the counter i preceded to get out some prescription drug i remember specifically this moment exactly because a a joke i always said i wanted to kill myself by overdosing i held the drug container a hard a i could with my hand i swear if i wa n't a complete unfit wimp i would crushed that bottle i wanted to overdose but i could n't get myself to open the damn thing do n't do it i do n't want to die please just leave me alone i went after to retrieve my suicide weapon and cry that i did n't want to die at the same time i did both voluntarily i wa in full absolute control yet i forced myself to do both and both action were so not me at the same time both were irrational emotional i 'm not like that i know i 'm not even when i am consumed by boredom and endless apathy thats me but this wa different i also forced myself to do these thing my logical self drove me to drive my own mental state into suicidal sadness it wa all intentional but so not me to end this off i just wan na say after what seemed an eternity i ended up letting go of the drug i stopped cry completely and i said one phrase i 'm such a fucking retard i wan na die but i said it in a sarcastic tone which wa a relief because i wa back to being me i ended up sleeping right after that and did n't awake till next day damn i expected this to be shorter i wanted to cover all of my stress of life in this post like social expectation lonliness despite being surrounded by people and deep paranoic anxiety constantly but this is too long for me bye i guess if someone read this,1

suicide scenario doe anybody else look at seemingly harmless moment and just think if i jumped off the roof right now i would finally end it but nahhhh we have ramen for lunch today and it 's my favorite i also make up the whole plot and basically calculate the chance of each method like oh but our roof is on the 6th floor so i would probably have more than a chance to survive the fall there is also a chance i could end up living more miserably at a phyc ward or on a wheelchair from breaking all my bone there i also might fall on top of a car which will cost my parent an even bigger fortune i could just jump right now and fake it a an accident but i do n't want my parent to pay even more money it 's very random and is just my head trying to invent new suicide method to keep my selection open it 's like wtf brain i feel so uncomfortable whenever i do that and the moment is usually ruined even if it 's very beautiful i do n't think i 'm the only one doing this but i 'm probably just hella suicidal,1

i wrote a bunch of different variation of kind of detailed suicide note and piece about it read if you want writing ha helped me calm down a little note the philosopher there really isn t a point to life if i spend my entire existence trying to help people the people i helped will just die off with time i will die they will die and any memory of u will die too but the earth will go on nature will continue uninterrupted by my demise unflinching the tree will never fear their own mortality i will rot into their soil and they will grow stronger from my decomposing corpse so why is it that we value human life above all else why is your soul worth more than the rabbit under the fern if you will both be eaten by the same worm if you will become the same dust is it a basic myth that we tell ourselves to justify our violence against other creature what is the logic of people who think they ve found their purpose do they believe that they will make a lasting difference a few generation sure but nothing last everything we know today will one day crumble under the foot of new generation forgotten like the birthday of extended family note the fml i ve been thinking about andrew a lot lately is this how he felt is this the fate we left him too no probably not he had more problem than i do i just consider suicide after every heartbreak because is living really worth going through

for a long time and i don t know what s different about now maybe i m getting weaker with age oh well note the bae justin im sorry i don t want you to think this wa your fault it wasn t i love you i loved you but i fucked up i fucked everything up like i always do and i can t live with myself knowing that i want you to be happy forget about me please this is the third time i ve tried writing this note but it s the only one addressed to you i wa trying to pretend that you weren t the most important thing in my life when i wa writing those and it just felt wrong so i have to write to you just

the only person i trust to do it i don t know when exactly i ll do it yet i wa planning on jumping off of the bridge when i m in san francisco but it would cost my family a lot to ship my body home once it s found maybe i ll or myself to death we ll see i should have talked to you when we were together but i just brushed our problem under the rug like they never even existed i guess that wa my biggest mistake i m sorry that i hurt you that way i should have been there for you i should have been by your side i wish you could know the real me i spent so much time trying to pretend i wa normal so that you might be able to love me that i never really got to know you either i guess if you want you can read my journal and letter all they will tell you is that i have been very very sad for a long time please know that this wasn t your fault you did what you thought wa best for you and that s exactly what you should have done i wa not good for you give your cat some pat for me until we meet again note the formal apology this is not your fault this is not anyone s fault but my own i wasn t strong enough to handle the thing that i brought onto myself even with all of the help in the world i am sorry to put my friend and family through what i know is to come of this but i hope they all understand that this is for the best layla chris i am sorry to put you through this again no one should have to face that kind of loss but i am unable to handle myself i have no will to live to see another day another sunset another first kiss the light doe not outweigh the dark in my life and if the same is true in your own life i hope that you are stronger than i have been the people i once thought to be my friend no longer care to say hello to me in passing many of the people who i once loved and called my friend distrust and in some case despise me it hurt me to remember what once wa knowing that the loss of the thing that once made my life live-able ha resulted from my own action i have tried to be better but i have failed mom dad i am sorry that you have to burry a child and i am sorry that i will not live long enough to make you a proud a i ha once hoped i would now at least you can worry about yourselves and find happiness i am also sorry for the people that helped raise me the family member and teacher and neighbor with whom i wa extraordinarily close i hope they know that they have not failed me but i them i apologize the most for the friend i rarely see my penn pal my long time no see they will wonder where i have gone someone who ha access to my laptop please let kathy know what ha happened to me her email should be in a folder labeled pen pal she is a good friend and ha been for many year and i do not want her to think that i have left her she doe not deserve that on the other hand please do not idolize this i wa hated by many disliked by even more please do not allow those who belittled attacked and degraded me use my death a a tool for dealing with their fear of their own mortality if they did not already know that this wa coming they were not a friend i am not asking for blame because that will just be more painful but please don t lie to make yourselves feel better about this come to term with yourselves if you must blame someone blame me if you want to blame truthfully blame society those friend who knew this wa coming will probably be hit the hardest i am sorry there is nothing that they could ve done i have struggled with depression for many year i began self harming in elementary school more notably a i grew older i have abused drug and alcohol and men for year in order to deal with my emotional issue to those i have caused suffering in trying to deal with this— anthony justin— i am again sorry although i have tried to hide the issue in my life from those around me it ha become increasingly difficult for me so it is likely that you suspected this i don t need to list every terrible thing that ha ever happened to me to justify my choices— many of you already know— and if i did do so it would likely be seen a manipulative yes i have sought out psychiatric help and therapy i ve tried every outlet for my emotion art writing music sport sex drug love and it ha been ineffective i have developed digestion and joint issue a a result of my stress i often cry so hard that i throw up although i have been very happy i am more often than not very very sad there are some people who chose to abandon me even knowing that this wa coming some of which i know care very much about me and are trying to help themselves i am sorry to have pushed you away i would have liked very much for our relationship to have ended on a higher note i am disappointed in myself and my action throughout my lifetime and have come to realize that no number of good deed will have me forget this i have been a bad granddaughter a bad student a bad peer a bad friend and a bad girlfriend i realize now that my past can not be shaken it seems that journalism the only thing i truly thrived in brought only more unhappiness to my social standing despite my love for it this letter is probably my least edited piece of writing this look much more like an apology than what it truly is but that is because suicide is often miscommunicated i am not doing this because of my last heart break or a bad grade or anything so trivial i do not want anyone to be blamed for this i did everything i could to make sure no one would be able to stop me please do not say i had a bright future ahead of me— those who have known me well know that this is the only ending i have available to myself it wa just a matter of when it could ve been twenty year from now but i would have just suffered longer although there are people to whom i would like to write individually i have chosen not to do so to spare their psyche i don t want to pour my heart out when it wouldn t change anything i know this because in the most relevant case i already have if they want to hear from me again give them my rough draft and my journal there is enough for another year of conversation with me at least i have contemplated this for many year and i am sorry to leave you all with this emotional burden i wish you the best note pov i am standing on the san francisco bay bridge and i will not survive my jump tomorrow or maybe next week depending on the tide they will find my body on the rocky shoreline my white lace dress will be heavy with cold pacific water and my skin will be marked with scratch from the sea floor maybe my eye will have rotted out by then or have been taken by seagull i may not look like myself but myself is not happy and i will be happy i am in the city for a convention i tell my roommate that i am leaving to take photo of the sun over the bay i will not come back although i look very put together on the convention floor my friend at home know that i am not if they haven t already accepted it they have a feeling in the back of their

tick tick tock day i set the date month ago month of searching for the slightest improvement the tiniest shread of hope but im still a empty a i wa back then the year of depression have taken their toll on me they 've worn me down on the 15th of april i planned to end my existence but a recent conversation convinced me that if im gon na end it all i might a well enjoy it so i have decided to extend my time untill my birthday on the 21st of june until then i 'll be be enjoying my time appearing fine to those who know me and getting drunk and enjoying myself on my own i doubt anything will change my mind but i might a well give myself some time who know plus there somethings awfully poetic about dying on the day you were born i felt like i should tell someone my thought and rather than upset and worry those around me i figured i would tell some random stranger who wont care all too much we im here until the 21st of the 6th let see how life fuck me over this time,1
honestly some day my head ha this mild discomfort which make me want to lay down it s not pain but more of a pressure and it s only when my day suck,1
what is really the point i 'm beginning to seriously consider giving everyone the middle finger and taking my life it 's mine after all i did n't ask anyone to bring me here nobody asked me if i wanted to be born i wa forced into a meaningless life because my mother just wanted to have me thing is recently i 've been thinking about the future and what do i want for myself and i just do n't see what 's the point of continuing i have many hobby in college studying what i liked since childhood relatively good financial situation i know a lot of people only thing missing is a girlfriend and i would pretty much have everything i hoped for in life so what 's the point see i do n't need anything else i 'm bored of life what is there to live for knowledge experience money when i die it go with me i already gave up on trying to find a girlfriend so having kid in the future to keep my legacy is n't a thing having fun what for same thing it go with me when i die helping the human race we showed ourselves that we just simply do not give a shit about eachother or the planet no matter what i will probably find a job and give money to my family for a while just to help with debt and then just finish it now i 'm not sad or anything i actually feel pretty calm now that i reached this conclusion i just do n't see the point of living a life i know ha no meaning for me so what 's your take on life what is your own meaning what keep you from giving up knowing that no matter what you accomplish you will end up just like everyone else,1
still wanting to end it all hey reader i have not done this for year but i 've noticed that some thought just wo n't go away i have some deep question and wonder if anyone can shine some light on it who am i i 'm and living in the netherlands had a nice youth on a small school and lot of friend when i wa about i started getting these very negative emotion the darkness in the future the helplessness the sadness but it wa mostly at night and could very well hide it from others my parent are n't very good emotional helper and did n't notice anything this continued growing older i have to add that i have a brother who wa very difficult at home he wa like depressed since i knew him now i know it 's probably he 's a bit autistic just like my father i always tried to be the happy one but that changed on my 18th i started smoking a lot of weed and just did n't accept my parent anymore what is going on now i just feel trapped inside a sick joke on the one hand my social anxiety prevents me to get actual help the depression just pump these negative feeling in me all day also suicide related of course my autistic side keep me angry for year it feel like the first day i wa angry but then everyday i want to keep doing my job it 's going very well but i also want to put a knife in my wrist or heart i want to have a girlfriend to share this with but also want to just disappear and never come back i want to tell my close friend how i truly feel but i also want to punch some of them to death yes i 'm afraid of death who is n't but the situation i 'm in keep giving me stress and i ca n't tell anyone about it on top of that of my friend are in the same position but did tell everybody all of them have been hospitalized and of them have now been alienated from our friend group we just ca n't recognize them anymore the other one is babling for a year now how it all come because of his ocd/adhd and his parent i do n't want to be a pathetic person who think he 's important man the circle i went threw how can i break this do i need to search for help i only want to do that if i 'm procent sure i have something but on the other hand i can play the human role very well i think i can never unseen the emotion and deep depth i have been in it will always be with me doe n't matter how much weed i smoke sorry for the long text and english but just wanted to write this off of me p no i do n't feel like committing suicide right now but it 's something that ha been following me for year it 's so scary,1
i agree with this a similar/ reverse idea though is that it 's not normal to dislike a ton of everyday thing about someone i used to dislike how an ex would say something just even their tone of voice or how they expressed their values/beliefs that wa one of a ton of everyday thing where i 'd suppress my feeling and go haha just a cute quirk i realized later that all those little thing were part of a larger issue i always found them to be disingenuous like they always seemed to be a smart as or something generally putting me down in the way they expressed themselves i then met someone with a ton of quirk but none of them actually bothered me to my core like that knowing the difference between a quirk and something actually problematic is important,0

i met my teenage crush in the supermarket today i wa with my year old son and pushing a wagon full of grocery when i spotted her on line waiting for the cashier to tally up her item i wa n't sure it wa her so i ventured her name debbie i said and gave her a small smile she turned around and looked at me after a moment 's hesitation her face broke into a huge smile oh my god hi how are you her voice had that same soft musical quality it had when i first fell in love with her all those year ago and her smile wa just a radiant it wa and i wa my dad had died very suddenly two year earlier and my mother had decided to check out of parenthood i still lived at home but she no longer considered me her child i wa a freeloader who wa n't carrying my weight it wa a very bad time for me to get away from her for a little while i had taken a ride with my good friend and his parent out to new jersey to visit his cousin who had just bought a new home there we got into the house which wa quite large and beautiful a we walked around debbie bounded from one of the bedroom hi she said to me enthusiastically and with an broad open friendly smile she wa beautiful tall and with light brown hair unlike every girl i had known to that point she had no air at all no attitude just an open friendly warm greeting that wa completely genuine she had just met me and wa already happy to see me i wa in love it wa n't a horny teenage thing this girl had made me feel happy with just a greeting she showed u around the house pointing out the feature with her open airy friendly way i felt like i wa on a cloud all of the heaviness of my hard life seemed to have vanished just by my being in the same room with her all too soon the visit ended debbie said it would be ok if i wrote to her no e-mail or texting then i remember sitting in my friend 's parent ford on the drive home i wa feeling a mixture of giddiness and sadness of having met her and having to leave her the feeling did n't go away in the week that followed i found my thought preoccupied with debbie and her lilting voice and her kind face my mother and older brother found out from my friend 's parent that i had made a friend with debbie i confessed to them that i wa in love with her at first they were amused but when my symptom did n't abate they grew in equal part irritated and annoyed i wa lovesick thought of debbie were the only thing that lifted me out of the depression of my daily life i could n't eat or sleep finally my mother got angry enough to destroy my little island of happiness she told me point-blank stop thinking about her you 'll never have her her parent want somebody fancy for her like a doctor or some rich guy you 're nothing we 're poor people they 'll never want you but despite being told this in one form or another many time my love for her persisted i wrote her and she wrote back i bought her a book for her 17th birthday she spent a few day at my friend 's house while her parent were abroad and i took her out to pizza and a movie we walked and talked and she smiled a lot at me with her kind eye even now over year later i think back on that evening and i feel light and airy ala time passed debbie went away to college far away i attended my local college but i never stopped thinking of her our correspondence grew le frequent and le comprehensive i went on to law school i began to despair that maybe my mother wa right that i wa n't good enough for her her parent knew of my crush on debbie my friend 's parent told me one day that the subject of my desire for her had come up in a family conversation her parent attitude wa he 's a nice boy but we 're looking for something different for her and that wa that my crush turned into a shattered heart a the year passed i recalled debbie fondly and with a leap of my heart in i learned that she had gotten engaged to a medical student a brilliant guy from a wealthy family and so my mother had been right all along and now i 'm year old overweight and graying and still carrying the bitterness in my heart from having lived in my shattered home and having my heart broken that time and a few time by other girl later on but today i met debbie in the supermarket she 's now her light brown hair starting to gray and little left of her year old figure but her voice wa just a sweet and lilting and her smile wa just a bright and open even today after all these year my heart started to lighten even a she spoke to me about the wedding she had just made for her eldest daughter i started to feel that same love for her although now it wa mixed in with sadness and regret over the passed year and what might have been in a different reality it really is true once you love someone they live in your heart forever,1
i revisited my first almost suicide attempt probably this wa the first attempt i wa in 5th grade so probably i wa or year old i wa bunking a class and sitting on the ceiling which wa very high in the school i don t remember what i wa feeling emotionally at that time but there wa a friend sitting with me i stood up and i wa literally gon na jump when a teacher spotted u we made her believe that we were just messing around but after the vacation i noticed that all the window got permanently locked i should have done it there and then it would have saved me a lot of pain now i don t even know how to behave like a normal human being and everybody anyways think i am weird the weird girl with scar mostly that s my image in school i explained my scar to be due to my hand getting stuck between the house divider cause i wa trying to click photo not really believable but it doe the job to silence others about it,1

i never do this and i do n't really know what i 'm doing why i 'm writing this idc if anyone read it or not i just had to vent yesterday my bf a got into a fight with his friend since a few year b because b asked a to go pay his plug a because b owed the plug some money a smoke too and he wa going to go buy some for himself and pay b 's loan but i asked my bf a not to go buy anymore because he promised me he wo n't smoke for a month and he 'll try to quit i got into a huge arguement with him not to go get anything anymore and at the end a finally caved and decided not to go because of me but b made a huge as issue out of it saying a is being cheap and he is ungrateful for everything he did for a. when a explained to b that i wa upset at him and i did n't want him going b said he doe n't give a shit about what i think or say and a better go pay the plug his loan at this both of them got into a huge arguement and started cussing each other out and b said he 'll come there and beat the shit out of a and a said yeah sure come i 'm not scared of you on the side note i have anxiety and these type of situation make me anxious so this whole time i wa on the verge of a panic attack because i thought i made my bf a lose one of his closest friend b i felt like shit and i felt completely guilty i kept thinking how all of this could have been avoided if i did n't stop my bf a from going to get the thing and paying off b 's loan after sometime my bf and i went our way but i wa still shaken because i knew b wa trying to physically fight a. i 'm friend with b 's wife and i texted her i told her the situation i told her my bf a wa trying to console me because i wa upset and i wa having panic attack because of her husband explain the situation to b and stop him from being stupid we were having a private conversation where i told her about my depression and how this is making me feel like shit because her husband is being disrespectful towards me and saying he doe n't give a shit about how i 'm feeling a long a a doe n't go pay the plug she agreed with me and said she 'll talk to her husband she screenshots all our conversation and sent it to her husband and both of them made it seem a if i wa trying to kill myself because my bf a did n't care about my well being and instead wa trying to go buy weed which is entirely not the case her husband wa being a douchebag and wa refusing to understand the situation a and b work at the same place and b showed their coworkers of my conversation with b 's wife saying how fucking crazy i am and how pathetic i am b wa saying how i wa being petty by texting his wife my bf a got upset with me but how wa i supposed to know it would turn out like this this girl called me her sister and said she prayed for me and she loved me and cared for me how wa i supposed to know she would go backstab me like this to give you a little more detail about u so b 's wife is white and b is pakistani he is super controlling and pretentious honestly he yell at some of his friend for drinking saying how that 's unislamic and they are n't real muslim but he drink himself he drank a few day ago with his other friend b is controlling and abusive he doe not let his wife see her friend or meet people unless he deems them appropriate and even if those people are b 's wife 's family like he doesnt let her see her cousin for god 's sake b pretend to be a holy man he literally take a picture of himself when he is in the mosque praying the friday prayer and post it in snapchat that is not right what kind of pure hearted person doe that he doe not let his wife listen to music because he doe n't think it appropriate for his wife but he himself listens and blast crude song himself he smoke everyday not cigarette the other stuff and drink and he threatens her that it is very easy for him to find a girl and he will if she doe anything that he can go to a club that day and have any girl he want he threatens he 'd divorce her when she left her entire family for him she eloped with him and her white family never thought he wa a good guy for her he forced her to wear the scarf and essentially said if she did n't wear the scarf and convert to islam he would not be with her and if she even looked at another guy he would leave her so said had to delete all her social medium account make a new one where the only people that she could add is not even her family but his so whatever they eloped her family wa very sad with her action and if he wa an actual good muslim and she truly converted for the sake of the religion they would not have the heart to make her family her parent sad like that they wouldve waited until her family understood them and respected their relationship but fuck it man idc it 's their life she recently got knocked up and they are having a kid but he still refused to let his druggie habit go he still smoke he still drink while arguing with his friend that it is haram and god forbid it and pop pill but they both had the audacity to accuse me and my bf of being terrible people how what sense doe that make i swear i prayed for the will being of this girl i looked out for her like she wa my sister i told her if there wa anytime she needed a place or anything just call me she told me she is afraid that if her husband left her she would have no where to go and if she went back to her family it 'll be too shameful for her she told me he almost wa about to beat her because he saw in her netflix watch list there wa movie he thought wa inappropriate wtf man wtf whenever we talked she would tell me her shit and i would never tell anyone not even my bf no matter what he said but she always told my personal thing like my depression and self harm to her husband when i begged her to not tell anyone any of these thing because it 's my own personal thing it hurt me and the fact that she screenshoted those message and sent those message to husband fuck it fine i accept it but the fact that he sent around showing it to his coworkers while mocking me and calling me crazy and saying how my bf doe n't care about me and wa leaving me for drug completely false it made me very upset it hurt me she didnt have to show those message to her husband she didnt need to tell him my thing like that and how can he call himself a muslim while going around mocking a depressed girl what kind of man is he the wife used to be depressed and used to cut herself so i thought she would understand me but she just hit me where it hurt the most she backstabbed me the worse way possible i felt like absolute shit so the next day i messaged how asking how dare she do that and how dare her husband do the thing he did while calling himself a righteous muslim i wasnt thinking properly and wasnt in my right state of mind and messaged her saying that i hope how they used my depression a a mean to mock me i hope their child go through what i go through and i hope she get mocked for it the way they mocked me for it i pulled some quran verse that went over how it is sinful to tell people 's secret i know i wa completely at the fault for saying that and i truly didnt meant it i would never wish that any human being face depression it is the worst thing imaginable at the end she cussed me and my bf out and i told her i can spell her secret like she spelled mine how she got an std from her ex boyfriend and gave it to her husband she told me which mean she cheated on her husband when they were together on the other side note she also hooked up with my bf too when she wa having a thing with her husband when she and her husband were together then i blocked her now i feel like shit complete shit i am sorry for what i did but i do not ever want to contact her idc how many guy she slept with idc about any of those but how can she screenshot mu message with me talking about my most vulnerable thing with her because she said she love me and go tell everything to her husband she kept the fact that she ever slept with her ex or my bf from her husband but she could n't keep my personal depression a secret from her husband when i personally asked her too now i feel like shit like going back to my old way because now i dont think i am worth anything i wa on my path to recovery yo and this wa a huge set back for me,1
i miss flash game i play game on my phone a lot but play game seems to mean play game for a couple of day then delete them the only game i 've really stuck with on my phone for the past several month is yu-gi-oh duel link which kind of brings me to my problem on mobile i see lot of very small game ketchapp 's game are a good example of this they 're the sort of thing that make flappy bird look only slightly uncomplicated but the graphic are charming and the gameplay is tight and fun there were lot of flash game like that i have fond memory of that game where you drove your armored vehicle around hit thing then bounced on thing it 's hard writing something with example when you ca n't even remember their name but the other type of mobile game i see is very large game maybe not large in term of complexity i do n't think anyone is going to put their score at game of war on their résumé unless they 're trying to prove they 're already rich and do n't need the job they 're applying for a some odd negotiation tactic these game are the one with timer energy although plain old energy seems to kind of be a relic of the day of facebook game and reddit 's dreaded in-app purchase honestly i 'm not that against in-app purchase for most game they really feel like paying for cheat code which some people are against but i never used cheat code outside of the gta series so it doe n't really affect me too much however these game are kind of infamous for making you want to do well in the game because well that 's the point of a game usually and making that only possible if you can outspend your rival but i 'm not even going to complain about that what i 'm mad about is that all those game have flooded the market and they 're all so similar competing for your time and money even if i had all the time in the world i only have the patience for one or two of those game i see all these high download count game and think to myself why are they playing clash of warchiefs when they can be playing battle of valor but that 's what i miss about flash game there were so many that were right in the middle when it came to how much time they expected from you roguelites rpgs that are short by rpg standard strategy game thing that you could play a lot or just a little of of course those still exist on mobile but a lot of time they cost money although not really a problem with google 's refund policy and i have a lot of trouble finding them with flash game i could just go to the highest rated game on kongregate armor game and newgrounds and there 's be good stuff tl dr there are a lot of really small arcade game of mobile and there are a lot of mmo style game that demand all your attention i wish there were more medium sized game like flash game often were what do you think about flash game and mobile game is that enough for automod,0

thinking of suicide only option left i m not in immediate danger i don t want anyone to panic but i ve been thinking of suicide i just got out of hospital a few day ago and nothing ha changed and i m back to my only option being suicide i ve had depression since i wa a child and i ve been through so many medication and therapy i ve exhausted all the resource provided and i m still the same i can t have a normal life i ve tried researching other option but there s nothing the only thing left to do is to kill myself i don t even want to die i just don t want to live like this anymore,1

thank you random girl from the store you made my day i live in a small town in turkey so today i went to a store nearby to buy some stuff coke and milk and cooky and coated peanut and thing like that when i got to the check out there were like six people queued which is pretty impressive for such a small store the cashier wa a pretty and hard-working young woman and she wa doing her best to get all the item quickly so that people do n't have to wait for long apparently she wa working alone at that time i wa the last customer in the line but a young guy before me said you go first sir i got ta get some other stuff i went before him and the girl immediately said her usual welcome to our store and started checking my stuff out she enthusiastically asked whether i wa interested in buying any of the thing that were on sale today with sample stacked right next to her and i gladly picked some pudding she said thank you and i replied thank you with a smile and then she said something right out of the blue have n't seen you in a few day is it that you had n't come here or is it that i wa n't here when you did come i wa stumped i did n't know what to say so i just said really i wa here yesterday which i ca n't really remember and she replied yes i know you came here yesterday but i mean before that you know i have n't seen you in like four or five day this is when my turkish failed me and i just mumbled um i do n't know really with a stupid smile and then pretended to be busy bagging my stuff she helped me bag them and before i left i gave her a big immensely grateful smile and said thank you very much and went home and now here i am telling you about it because it really mattered to me it mattered because someone who just randomly happens to work in a store nearby actually missed me noticed my absence it mattered because she felt safe enough to ask me where i 've been without worrying that i might respond in a rude or dismissive manner it mattered because i genuinely believed that no one cared and she simply and elegantly and with just a simple exchange proved me flatly wrong thank you random girl from the store you rock,0

i just rocked a phone interview and here s how i did it am sitting alone after having just had a really good phone interview they offered me the job on the spot and just wanted to share both my happiness and tip on what helped me so it might help anyone else who might be in a similar situation i spent about hour before the interview doing preparation i got sheet of paper and put bold title on the top of each about the organization and where the role fit in duty and accountability selection criterion other practical example and my question i then filled in information in my best handwriting on each sheet i used a notepad for scribbling down rough note for each on a separate paper but the important thing wa that i eventually wrote the good note down by hand this because i read something about the learning process that thing sink into your memory better when you write them by hand rather than type for the sheet i bullet pointed everything relevant i could find in the job description website writing key word in red for sheet and duty and selection criterion i put what wa listed in the job description bullet pointed down the left side of the paper again highlighting key word and then wrote how i fit each point with practical example on the right side for sheet i brainstormed other practical example of topic that i guessed would probably come up in interview question like common problem and innovation etc for sheet i listed the question i had i had all sheet laid out in front of me along with my cv and covering letter when the phone interview started it went so well and in the end i actually barely looked at any of the information but it wa all readily available in my head during so it went smooth like butter i ve never done this level of preparation before but i wa really pleased with how it paid off and just thought i d share it in case it could help any other job seeker out there,0

a few year ago i wa in a pretty dark place going through a deep depression and struggling to be a normal functioning human being i wa n't taking care of myself and spent most of my day playing video game or watching youtube video i slowly started to pick myself back up got a job started going back to school got a better job started rewarding my hard work and recovery process with a new pc and cute clothes i started feeling better about my appearance and lost a little bit of weight i put on due to my depression i wa doing so good and my recovery wa going so well i quit my job last october thinking i would have a better opportunity at another place of work but it ended up being so much worse i stupidly quit my new job so that i would n't force myself into so much stress knowing i 'm very mentally vulnerable to negative thinking however since then i have n't been able to find a job and have gotten to the point where i 've stopped looking i 'm back to not taking care of myself and back to playing video games/watching youtube video all day i just think it 's so idk the word maybe weird crazy that you can go from doing so well with getting better to slipping back into a deep depression in the blink of an eye,1
doe anyone else answer no to being asked if you re suicidal or have had suicidal thought recently sorry if title is weird it s late and i m typing this on my phone so i m not very good at articulating anyways some back-story i m 20f and have probably been suicidal since i wa i ve been to a mental hospital once in high school and hated it i went in for suicidal tendency i guess like i didn t attempt suicide but i wa afraid i would try something so i told my mom and she took me to a hospital which i wa thankful for but at the same time it just wasn t the best experience i have a very supportive family especially my poor mother just writing this out make me cry because i put her through so much and she never asks for anything from me except that i live and i m trying really hard just for her ugh okay back to my main point sorry recently i ve noticed that during my therapy appointment i find it easier to just say i m not suicidal or have no suicidal thought but this isn t true at all in fact i think my suicidal thought are returning at full force and there s no one i can tell except stranger on the internet i want to tell someone in my life what s happening but i m afraid i ll get pulled out of college and referred to a mental hospital this can t happen again considering i took a year off for my mental health last year i really want to talk to my therapist about what s going on but i m really worried that a soon a i mention the thought she ll pull me out is that what happens if i do tell her i m struggling and suicidal can she really just snap her finger and have me sent away i know she wouldn t but i feel like i have to be careful with what i say i don t know what to do but i don t want to leave college again i just want to finish out the year that s all i want thank you for reading,1

i fucking hate being alive i 'm a year old loser who wa diagnosed with aspergers when i wa whenever someone find out that i have this disorder they immediately treat me like shit it doe n't even affect my personality or behaviour they just hate me for having a form of autism because these people heard some story about people with autism they assume i 'm either a cold sociopath because i do n't always fucking cry or react to certain thing or that i 'm some r\ tard who doe n't understand literally anything or i 'm quirky and weird this ha been the case my entire life and nothing will ever change nobody see me a truly human but a threat or something to be mocked forever i just fucking love being told i 'm worthless nearly every day by people i know whom i thought trusted the reason why i try to keep my disorder a secret is because i 'm scared of this happening to me again i really wan na vent to my close online friend about it but i 'm scared they 'll betray me to since i 'll have to mention my situation to them when venting i do n't wan na find friend who also have autism because i my disorder doe n't affect me a much a it did when i wa a kid meaning i 'll have trouble connecting with them i just wish people just saw me a who i 'm literally supposed to be some nerd who like video game anime and art to the world i 'm sorry i wa born differently i 'm sorry i 'm literally the devil i completely deserve to be in pain i exist,1

i understand suicide i 'm starting to understand people who commit suicide it 's like when you know you have the rest of your life to look forward to but you look at your life and just ca n't imagine living it every day year after year you have people tell you it get better but it 's been year and it ha n't so it probably wo n't and you 're tired so tired you just do n't want to fight through the day anymore i think when you commit suicide it 's with the knowledge that there will be people hurting once you 're gone but the idea that your pain will end may make it seem worth it suicide is indeed selfish but perhaps for some they have to be selfish because for year they put everyone else first always gave and gave and gave and no one bothered to see how they were how they were managing if they were ok. maybe they were sucked dry by life and just could n't take it anymore for some life is fleeting and they live it to it fullest they enjoy it and love it but for others it so long never-ending painful being alive and living are two different thing maybe some people who commit suicide actually died a long time ago but the people in their life were so busy taking they could n't give a minute to realize death is funny like that it 's not always on a physical level i have struggled with my depression the majority of my life while those i care about thought i 've gotten better the reality is i 've just gotten better at hiding it there are night that i lie awake dreading waking up living the day that just ended again over and over it 's a cycle that never end nothing ever change nothing good is sustained life just continues tomorrow exactly the same a it wa today every bad decision plague me and loss i 've suffered haunt my thought on the rare occasion i attempt to reach out i know i will mostly be met with half hearted attempt to listen or understand there is usually only a distracted silence on the other end of the line night before last while lying awake i realized i understood people who committed suicide that scared me i am in a dark place and i have never felt more alone in my life this is a time where i could have used the most support at this time i no longer feel capable of maintaining relationship it 's taking so much effort and i need to put everything i have left into my child they have to be my primary focus and i 'm just not sure i have enough in me to be a good mom and daughter/sister etc,1

who is the greatest actor of all time and why who is the most outstanding actor you 've ever seen in a film/telivision/stage production and why would you consider them the best also can you give example for your reason my pick would have to be denzel washington not only wa he fantastic in remember the titan a movie about racism in sport and becoming a stronger team through loving diversity but he 's easily able to transform himself into any character he want with certain ease he 's one of the biggest name in hollywood which is why people continually want him to be in their movie outstanding actor and definitely a worthy contender for greatest actor of all time,0

there 's no other way out there is something wrong with me and nobody can tell me otherwise my relationship of month with the love of my life is crumbling his dad passed two week ago and wa sick for two month beforehand and his anxiety is taking over his life i have n't seen him since the funeral week ago and when we do call or text i walk on eggshell because i never know what i might say will set him off i ca n't do anything to help him even just existing make it worse for him i am useless i ca n't express my suicidal feeling because nothing could compare to what he 's going through he say he is n't sure he can continue our relationship because i 've become a trigger point for his anxiety even just me calling him yesterday to ask if i could stop by to see him and his family on easter wa enough to set him off i 'm a toxic presence without even meaning to be it 's just who i am but i am not ready to lose him i ca n't go through another breakup that i did not want i ca n't be abandoned again i ca n't explain to people again that he left i ca n't be faced with people 's sympathy and empty well fuck him you deserve better 's when i know that i do n't i ca n't dodge reminder of him again and try to suppress happy memory with him because remembering the good time hurt so bad and by again i mean i 've done this before i 've been left before again by someone i truly loved and wa so happy with and it came out of nowhere he blind-sighted me i still do n't know why he left to this day but obviously it wa something irreparably wrong with me it look a full year for me to feel just ok. at the time i thought it wa the worst thing that could and would ever happen to me but i wa wrong the worst thing would be to have to re-live it because at least with the first go-round there wa hope that something good would present itself to me after the heartbreak i 'd endured and it did but now the cycle is happening again and i have no hope that if he leaf me i 'll be ok. i wo n't be because now i know i am worthless useless a burden i know now that it really is me not them nobody will ever truly love me maybe i could find love again but i know it would end just the same way i ca n't do this again i wo n't if i lose him i will end it he wa the only thing driving my life forward we had plan to get married to buy a house he wa living with me if that get pulled out from under me i have nothing to look forward to but the whole thing happening over again with some other poor soul i have friend but two of my closest one moved away this year for their master 's degree and will likely stay there they are happy and have their whole life ahead of them i do nothing for them but bring them down i like my job but i do n't make enough money to have a very bright future i only make enough to live my debt is year if not decade away from being paid off the only thing i would ever consider staying for is my family it would devastate them and i love them dearly but they too will be gone one day and even now i ca n't keep burdening them showing up at their house in tear and having them console me week after week it would be fairer to them for me to leave what a testament it is to my weakness and uselessness that i ca n't even deal with the thought of this breakup without feeling suicidal i ca n't even wait to see if it actually happens if he stay with me i do n't deserve it,1
this is a very obvious statement but we are n't born depressed unfortunate circumstance in life can be very depressing of course i 'm currently marveling at the idea that there wa a time when i wa n't depressed i know this probably is n't that helpful but for some reason it seems like a hopeful idea that there wa a time when i wa n't so unfocused anxious etc etc i feel like it 's tied very strongly to memory- if i lost all of my memory would i still be depressed i would still feel bad from mistreating my body but i would n't feel the shame and embarrassment and stuff like that again it 's very obvious but it seems good to note because we do have some control in how much we daydream about all the negative stuff that ha happened to u i 'm sure this is nothing new i 'm no psychologist just a thought that seemed hopeful to me atm,1
one of these day now it 's 4am and i can not sleep i 'm too busy thinking of the various way to put an end to my life i think overdosing will be the best way to go i have fantasized about my own death for year knowing that i have the power to end thing whenever i can gave me peace i 'm year old and have n't achieved anything in my life all of my friend from high school are studying to get their master degree while i had to change major time and have n't got my ba my parent have invested so much in me but it wa all in vain i will never be the successful son they want me to become i always hurt thise i love the most both accidentally and on purpose many people have told me that they no longer want to hang out with me because when i 'm depressed i suck the life out of everyone around me they 've told me that they become depressed just by looking at me i believe that i 'm doing everyone a huge favor i think i 'm gon na do it tomorrow,1

hi there i 'm a year old male who turn in august i have been struggling with depression for a few year now and it 's all coming to a sort of unbearable boiling point i have completely entirely wasted the phase of my life and i 'm completely devastated about it if you 'll excuse this i 'm going to allow myself to be dramatic and expressive in this post i just need to get this out throw it out in the world and see if anyone can help me honestly i can say i 've struggled with this all my life but it 's been more severe since all i did in my younger year wa play video game i did n't learn a skill that would blossom into a career i did n't grow into a man i stayed a child and i am a child now in high school all i did wa waste my potential and genuine ability so i could play game and not have to think about responsibility my senior year i did n't even apply for a college i graduated and went to a community college even though i did n't know why i wa there from that point all i did wa aimlessly fail school for year meet a toxic girl first love that broke my heart after a month relationship 21-almost and instead of being a strong person and pushing through the heartbreak i then let that heartbreak tumble into a toxic rut of depression that lasted for a year where i left school and did absolutely nothing but work an unsustainable job delivery driver with my own car that is now almost used up lay around and put on pound once that depressive period related to my ex wa over i realized with shock that i had done absolutely nothing during that time and failed an opportunity to gain inner strength so what did i do did i snap out of it and start climbing upward no i wa so horrified and i slid into an even darker existential depression that ha lasted up to current day and is reaching a boiling point the good news is that after three semester of just laying around not even using the time off to do something adventurous or awesome i started back into school this spring and though my gpa is shit from my earlier failing i will almost surely finish with a 's in both my two class this semester i still have no idea what i want to do long-term but i 'm ok with that what i 'm realizing now is sort of an exponentially increased version of what i realized after my first rut i now realize that not only have i done nothing with my recent time but i 've done nothing during the entire period of my life but wallow and i will never be able to do it over i 'm almost and i 'm starting to feel my perception of time speed up this is quite honestly making me panic severely i feel like i 'm going to blink and be then blink again and be i do n't really know what to say i feel so up against it i could have spent the last year actually finding myself or traveling backpacking adventuring at the very least i could have been responsible and had my b.s by now and now i could be adventurous for a period before getting a job or going to grad school but now i wo n't finish my degree until i 'm or and i could be before i 'm done if i want to pursue further education i see people who are and going on adventure taking advantage of that time people i know and it make me sob inside i feel that there is some neoteny going on here the thought of the magic of childhood ending ha always been too much for me to think about i feel that these year are a result of this i wa terrified to grow up now i 'm at the age where i 'm on the roller coaster of adult time with or without my permission and i wasted those precious fun transition year i wish i had done something responsible in the past year i wish i had worked hard maybe learned a trade in my teen so i could have moved out felt secure and pursued a fulfilling career with my foot under me i ca n't bear the weight of the situation i 've put myself into i ca n't even think about it straight enough to organize this post the only responsible thing i 've done is pay off 2k in debt last year that 's it my parent look at me with this look in their eye like they 're thinking what is he doing with his life that they can sense the personal hell i 've boxed myself up in the reality of this is so damn final every time i watch a movie i have this sort of sorrowful pang in my heart a i watch the heroism of the character spiderman made me long to be and start my youthful adult adventure but do it right this time even about my childhood i feel the same way if i see a character in a movie being taught by his father to be a self-sufficient man it make me desperately wish i had spent my youth building skill or learning self-sufficiency instead of gaming and gaming i just do n't know what to do my heart begs to have another chance and i of course know that 's an impossibility so i feel paralyzed by finality this part about my time perception speeding me up is what really started this boiling point i 'm cracking under the weight of it i want to grow into being a man learn skill become secure and self-sufficient go on adventure have a period of joyful expression and free adventure before i have to walk into the monotony of adulthood but now even if i do these thing i 'll push my degree off even further or my bank account even lower and i 'll be in my 's before i even get to where most people are at my current age i do n't know what to do i do n't know what i should do i do n't even really know what i want to do i do n't want to be i do n't want to have this weight on me i want to take this darkness and use it to make me stronger wiser more experienced self-sufficient mature in the truest sense of the word i want to experience a full more year not a cheapened sped up version that only feel youthful year i just want to conquer this and finally experience fulfillment adventure and joy,1

the silver lining i 've been suicidal since my teen year i recently turned i still do n't feel better about life the universe or anything however i 've used my suicidal thought and depression a a way to not feel anxious about taking risk or trying new thing this is a realisation i came to last year and it ha helped me a lot my reasoning is that if the result of my action are bad enough then i could always just kill myself it 's a safety net basically maybe this can help others a well just know that you do n't have to give up and die you can let suicidal thought work for you and at least stand a chance of feeling a little bit better during the darker day by knowing that you always have a way out so please get out there and live a little it ha kept me alive for over a decade,1

i just needed to talk about this i 'm in my second semester of college right now and thing are n't exactly going my way i barely made it out of a pretty depressing first semester i 'm in a stem major and i enrolled in rotc last semester because it 's been my dream for the longest time to go to space one day but i 'd settle for being a pilot too anyway in my first semester i wa depressed because the shift in difficulty of academic wa incredibly jarring to me and i had trouble making friend which made me think something wa wrong with me i wa failing a math class and rotc wa inherently stressful and i just felt alone ashamed and just shitty a lot of the time but i just barely passed the math class and i made a lot of friend second semester roll around and thing are starting to look up i finally feel comfortable in rotc i get a on my first chem exam there are still thing i 'm sad about but i 'll talk about that later anyway i 'm feeling generally happy about the semester so far then i get a on my first math exam i dug myself into this hole again that 's okay though i 'll just do better on the next one and the final my academic performance start slipping across the board but i 'm only in trouble in my math class fast forward about a month or so i 'm told that i do n't medically qualify for rotc because i wa on adhd medication year ago this is devastating to me i wa finally feeling comfortable i had finally made friend and i thought adhd wa n't going to be an obstacle for me anymore i had never identified with a certain group or felt like i wa a part of something worth being a part of before so to have that dangled in front of my face and then ripped away felt horrible it 's okay though it 's not the end of world because i 'm still eligible to apply for officer training school after i graduate two day later i meet with cadre they review my case and tell me that because of a certain skin condition i do n't medically qualify for military service which mean i ca n't be a pilot i went back to my dorm and for the first time in my life i seriously considered suicide it felt like i wa in a nightmare like i wa presented with a puzzle that i could n't solve i wanted to hurt someone or myself i did n't do anything though i did n't really know what to do a week later i take my second math exam of the semester a week from that i find out i failed and i 'll have to drop the class i studied really hard and i thought i got at least an it 's incredibly frustrating to go from high school where i never studied for anything and almost never got below an on a test or quiz where i wa good at math and science and academic in general to college where i can actually study for quiz and exam and almost never get above an it 's even more frustrating when my friend and people on my floor talk about how they got b and a on the same exam i took i 'm running out of way to convince myself i 'm not a fucking moron i just feel like such a fraud in more way than one i 've also never had a girlfriend so that 's always a reason for me to feel like a waste of skin i 've never experienced mutual romantic love i have friend yeah but they do n't need me i 've always had a problem with comparing myself to other people and that 's all i 've been doing recently and i just start to feel awful if i 'm alone with my thought for too long i feel like i have nothing to be proud of anymore sorry for making this really long i 've never talked about most of this stuff with anyone and my friend and family are n't very good at comforting i 'm pretty sure nobody know i 'm unhappy and i 'm too afraid to change that i just need to talk to someone,1

and i normally never let my heart get involved for this reason but i fell so hard for the most incredible girl i 've ever met in my life and we just had to break thing off yesterday because she found out she is moving across the country after we graduate college in may you can see my post history for a long detailed mental breakdown about the situation if you want but that 's the gist of it we only were together for month but i have never had a serious relationship or allowed myself to get even close to that being with her for the short time i did made me such a healthier and better person in many way i went from smoking a ton of pot to not even thinking about it when i wa around her being with her boosted my confidence so much in every way and made me want to be the best person i could be to ensure i do n't lose her she gave me motivation for everything that i needed it for like doing well this last semester of college for an example i really wa the happiest with my life and mentally healthiest i have been in a long long time a cliché a this is she made me feel so complete so whole now all of this ha come to the complete opposite i have test this week and i ca n't even get out of bed my pillow smell like her her favorite song wo n't get out of my head and i ca n't close my eye without seeing her beautiful face or hearing her beautiful laugh after she 's made me lose my shit laughing myself how do i deal with this i know i 'm young and will probably eventually find another person but this girl wa such a fucking perfect match for me that i ca n't imagine i will ever find a valid replacement i 've barely ever opened myself up emotionally to a girl until her and i opened wide the fuck up to her now we know that we have to stop thing where they are before we get even more attached this is the most unfair thing that 's happened to me in my life i wa so ahead of myself in thinking i found my dream and in the span of day it went from having the best weekend of my life with this girl to a conversation ending in so i guess this is it i thanked god this weekend several time for bringing this girl into my life i feel so cheated,1

i 'm not particularly good at anything and feel like i should kill myself i 've struggled with suicide ideation for several year and sometimes would come close but never actually go through with it i think about it almost constantly though one of the driving factor is that while my best skill is art i 'm still not particularly good at it and have no skill in anything else failing at that would leave no other career option for me and i 'd be basically proving to my family and friend who already have no faith in my choice that they were right all along and i 'm a failure i really feel like nobody would miss me all that much if i were gone i study animation which i wholly regret and none of my peer like me at all i live in california and when the wildfire were going on i wa in class and received an alert that one had happened close to my home i panicked a little and said aloud i might need to stay at a friend 's place if something happened and a fairly popular classmate who 'd overheard my situation completely did n't care and told me not to call ahead be rude and imposing on someone else in the same breath he 'd called me wasteful for not finishing my snack it seems like such a small thing to be fixated on but i feel like my other classmate feel the same way about me even my own friend do n't really care about my work—they 've promoted and commission other friend but just kind of ignore mine and one even admitted she never thought very highly of it i 've abandoned a friend group recently because i found out several guy in that group were stalking and sexually harassing another close friend of mine and nobody else wanted to speak up against it a a result i do n't really have a university life outside of my school or boyfriend anymore and i feel like a loser i feel like i 'm just such a fundamentally unlikeable and untalented person and with nothing positive to offer the world and there 's really nothing left for me and people would move on quickly if i were gone,1
