nothing to lose each day i lose more and more of the little hope i can muster i just wan na say fuck you asshole to everyone i know and vanish for a while i thought for a while it would be cruel to my adoptive mom she did n't choose to adopt me but rather sister died and my father wa out of the picture but i 'm more and more convinced i 'd be setting her free rather than making her sad just like when you have that very sick relative with no hope of getting better and when they finally die people are more relieved than sad i deserve to die and make room for someone who 's worth it do n't tell me otherwise because it wo n't be true you do n't know me i wo n't be missed and i know i 'm the only one to blame,1
hello everyone first off a i 'm sure is the case for most of you this post wa extremely hard to write i do n't like complaining about my depression/anxiety because life is stressful for everybody i am in a pretty good situation overall with a good family great girlfriend great friend and a nice apartment yet despite all that i feel so incredibly shitty most of the time it make me feel guilty why should i feel like crap when i have it so much better than probably of the world yeah everyone get stressed by work traffic money etc but it 's called life these are thought i have all the time which is why i do n't like to talk about my feeling much i see a therapist and i do n't really mind bitching to him because he get paid to listen to me but i absolutely hate talking about it otherwise the thought of making my problem other people 's problem is horrible to me another thought that i have is do i just use depression/anxiety a an excuse to avoid my responsibility like am i just not mature enough to deal with real life so i can just say to myself hey i 'm depressed so it 's okay that i do n't give maximum effort i am so easily distracted and have such a hard time concentrating i often just think i 'm incredibly lazy and that i use depression a an excuse which in turn get me more depressed ha anyone had these thought before and apology if this ha been discussed in this subreddit i 'm brand new here i just do n't feel like i 'm cut out to deal with the real word i do n't have whatever it is to be successful professionally between social anxiety inability to concentrate and just extreme dread of working or doing anything productive anyway thanks for reading i know this is a giant ramble glad to have somewhere i can just write down all my incoherent thought,1
the only thing stopping me is that i m a coward i would be dead by the end of this morning if i wasn t i already would be even i have a well laid out plan that i can and might go through with it would be so easy i hate life and yet something in me force me to keep going and i hate it i would be happier if i could just die but i can t this entire night ha been hell a rollercoaster of tunnel and sunlight while i contemplate whether i should end it all i am after all worthless human life ha no intrinsic value i can t do anything i m forgetful everyone hate me i said recently that i changed my mind about doing it i won t i said i learned something though if you feel better you ll probably feel worse in just a couple day i m ready to die i have it all planned out it could happen this morning i just want to be dead but there s no easy way to have that aside from aging,1
and it s becoming really tiresome fighting it all off i m finding myself aggressively trying to live a better life just to stop giving myself excuse to be miserable but nothing work tiny thing upset me i m frustrated about not liking my ge class i m upset at myself for not doing art in a while and sucking at it i m desperate to play piano but i m pissed off because my apartment is too small for a keyboard and the only public piano is missing the fucking gain pedal and i m upset that it hasn t been fixed i m upset that one of my roommate stopped talking to me for no reason and is giving me the could shoulder every time i ask how her day is i m upset at myself for never learning how to bike i hate myself for being a shitty driver who rarely get a chance to improve with practice i m upset that after month of harping on the leasing office to do some maintenance that benefit everyone in my unit when they finally came home to fix the issue with the closet door in the room one of my other roommate warded them off because that same shit roommate wa taking one of her usual midday nap i feel like i m the only one who s trying tiny thing tiny thing that have never upset me before are bothersome now and i m feeling even shittier for it i hate what i ve become no matter how many time i go out with friend i always go back home feeling like the same shitty person it s exhausting i need a fucking piano maybe i should man the fuck up and try to draw again or maybe i ve gotten so shitty at doing both that it s better if i just don t i m sick of myself fuck,1

i feel broken i can t get away from negative thought of myself embarrassed from past action or interaction they come flooding in when i ask myself why i m struggling alone despite every effort to be a part of the life of others saw the post on the front page today about friend something to the effect of not finding any if you re looking for them but if you re just concerned with being one then you ll find many the thing is my life is pretty much me setting myself on fire to keep others warm but nobody is inviting me out nobody ha conversation where they mention something because they thought of me. i m good for helping everyone else get what they want and need but i m practically invisible in every other aspect of my life i feel this anger and sadness constantly medicine doesn t squelch the feeling that i m broken or better off dead i know it would hurt a few people but i am just so tired of feeling alone and unimportant,1

it suck that being sad having suicidal issue hating everything or just being depressive in general make you edgy idk if it 's the right term when you are a teenager it seems like you can not have depression you are just being like every teenager i think it is true most of u have difficulty to control our emotion and we are going through a lot of change but know the difference between having a normal teenager period and being depressive idk if you make the difference between depressive and depressed in english in my language we do most of the teenager can feel depressed but when you deal with real depression you are depressive i am ashamed to talk about my situation and it is making it even harder because people will think i am depressed and making too much about it edit what i love about this sub is everyone understand each others thanks for your comment it make me feel le alone,1

ever since i wa kid i 've seen poverty in my house my dad wa a driver for school child and he did n't earn enough he did n't change his designation a a school driver for almost year even with tight circumstance my parent decided to have me with my eldest sibling being year elder than me all through childhood i saw my dad fighting and being an unemotional dummy with my mom and mom wa n't any better she wa extremely ignoreable towards me never emotionally assessing me and i only had my sister to mentally take care of me for the most part most of my childhood wa spent asking for even the basic thing like good clothes jacket in winter and trouser in summer a funny a it may seem i have fond memory of asking my parent about these two thing every winter and summer and almost always being rejected even though they had money they would n't buy so after some time i even stopped asking for these too my elder brother wa the family bully and still is to this day however he is somewhat stable now throughout my childhood i remember working\ for him bringing him glass of water a he sat in front of tv all day doing no house chore at all and if i refused he would either abuse me verbally and one time he even smacked me for not bringing him remote battery from the market in december i still remember that day and it will safely remain etched into my memory for a long a i live my parent did nothing i remember my dad cursing him behind his back because he never had the ball to tell his elder son that he wa a pain in the as for the whole family and my mom always defending my brother and in general not giving a f about me being used a a servant the only people in my family who actually cared for me somewhat were my two sister who were a tired of our house a i am but they got married when i wa in 8th grade so soon they too left .since an early age i had made strong bond with friend in school and only they were the true relationship for me i went to a new school in 5th grade and from 5th to 10th i made really amazing friend who are still my friend to this day after school ended intermediate college started in my country after highschool you study year in an intermediate college then you do bachelor from a university i wa actually among the school topper so i got a full scholarship for year in the intermediate college it wa a well known college of my country punjab group of college to be exact i spent two of the most amazing year of my life studying there a i made lot of friend and we made extremely memorable memory there.after that the real hard stuff started now it wa time to get into university i of course had no money and most of the good institution did n't offer loan or scholarship even the scholarship they gave were even on it wa too much amount for me to pay i tried getting job to support my due but it could n't cut it i applied in a public university which wa affordable for me but even after preparing my test from book the result came out to be something i had never expected so i did n't get admitted there .i even asked few big company if they could give me loan or charity money to pay for my university due yes i went this far to get money that i literally had to beg in front of some company bos but to no avail in the meanwhile i saw my friend going to top notch university because their parent could afford them it wa extremely painful for me to just sit at my house and seeing all my other friend going to the top university and enjoying their life to the fullest i had to wait for month after my college ended and after that i had applied in a below average public university that is primarily a literature university but it ha an i.t sector is close to my house and is affordable for me so having an option to discontinue study and doing a job or taking admission here a a last resort i chose the latter i wa mentally prepared because i knew it wa n't such a great instituion and i.t wa n't it 's top field but it turned out to be far worse than i had anticipated .the teaching staff wa novice and most of the kid there were also from poor family or who got rejected from some good public sector university so a a last resort they decided to come here just like me it took me a lot of effort to accept that this will be the place where i would study for the next year and probably the most important year of my life i 'm currently studying here and it is n't getting any easier i 'm doing poor on my test and i even failed calculus in the first semester i just ca n't bring myself around to put any effort into anything anymore everyday i get up to go here i feel worthless and miserable it 's just an everyday routine for me now my depression is on it 's peak nowadays and i do n't know how longer will i be able to hold it like this and i 'm seriously getting mentally weaker day by day i just ca n't see all my other friend living so easier life and me having to try so hard to get even the basic thing i need in life.i got a job finally a a home tutor for two kid near my house they 're both stubborn kid so i have to work extra hard on them which completely exhaust me but i 'm ok with the job a it pay and is near my house they pay me rs.6k per month out of these 6k 4k is spent on the internet bill and the installment i pay for a phone i bought a i had no phone previously i get only 2k out of it which is not enough to get through the month and even in this university i feel miserable a i do n't have enough money to buy new clothes i 've been wearing the same shoe for almost a year now and they 're wearing off i feel a if i have reached my tripping point now every one of my friend is doing ok in their life at least when it come to institution they study at i wa never the kind who would compare his life with others but now my brain kinda automatically doe it for me and it hurt i feel like my health is going in a downward spiral i 'm gaining weight because of the shitty food i 've been eating since i wa a child and now i feel that they are messing up with me from the inside not to mention i feel strong tension in my head whenever i 'm teaching those kid and i have no idea why that 's started happening at this point in life i 'm really tired i ca n't stop hating my parent because i genuinely do n't feel any sort of love for them because ever since i wa a kid i 've seen them acting like stranger and that 's what they are to me now my elder brother still life with u even though he 's and ha a daughter he 's kind of a freeloader he is currently unemployed and is becoming more and more irritable day by day my hate for my family ha become more than ever stronger whenever i discus it with my friend they say the obvious respect your parent you should n't hate your parent etc i just do n't know how even though a part of me love them but a majority in me ha no affection for them and only despises them.they are something that i do n't intend to be ever but my anxiety and depression skyrocket when i see the condition i 'm in now and how all of my friend and relative enjoy their life i really want to get away from this family and this place but i have no mean and find no way in the furute to get rid of them.i feel a if i 'm gon na commit suicide i feel a if it 's becoming more and more inevitable a each day is passing by i have no idea how i can control my thought and how i can get rid of or at least decreae my depression my mind doe n't let me live because of all the constant comparison i do with my friend 's life even though i do n't want to i do n't enjoy my university and i do n't want to study here but i have to a it is my last chance at getting an education i feel a if this post might be the only thing that would explain how i felt because i do n't usually go into such detail a i do n't want my friend to leave me because of how shitty my life is and i do n't want to seem complaining so i keep thing mostly to myself.i just find no way of treating my depression and i think it might end soon for me my father 's getting older day by day and i 'm afraid he might die in a few year after his death thing are going to get real shit for me and i know my brother 's not gon na support my mother and me in any way and i 'll have to take the whole burden suicide is something i 'm being compelled to more and more everyday.idk i want at least one person even someone i do n't know on the internet to really know what i went through and why i did what i did i 'm trying my best to not do what i intend to to but i do n't know how long i will be able to hold myself thanks for reading if you made it this far i just hope i keep living because otherwise religion say if you commit suicide you 'll burn in hell for eternity well if life 's fk 'd at least i do n't want my afterlife to be fk 'd too so if there 's any afterlife waiting for me i do n't want it to be spent burning in flame .i hope i find a cure for my depression and something good happens

good on you drug and alcohol should scare you i used them to get through this same feeling for so long year and i 'm only now i 've done so much permanent damage and missed so much social development i would suggest you try a change of medication rather than a change of dosage i 've been through different antidepressant before finding one that worked for me and have been on it for a year now i 'm a long way from being better but i 've made a lot of progress there were thing other than medication that really helped me pretend your an actor decide on what kind of person you want to be how you want people to see you and just act it out ignore your feeling and what your brain is telling you and eventually you will become that person get angry it 's a great motivator whenever you feel really down get angry and tell those feeling to fuck off a catchy phrase help too i sing i wo n't back down to myself whenever i 'm really struggling,0
here s my suicide note i 'm sorry isabel but this world is just not my place i 've tried for so long to fix this and fit in i 've come to realize this world 's full of sin there 's nothing for me here i 'm just a waste of space i 've got no reason to stay here with this awful race it 's a disgrace i wa misplaced born in the wrong time and in the wrong place it 's ok though 'cause you 'll see me soon you 'll know when your time ha come just look at the moon a it shine bright throughout the night and remember everyone 's facing their own fight but i ca n't deal with the pain i 'm not a fighter you 'll make it through the night just hug your pillow tighter so let the world know that i died in vain because the world around me is the one to blame and i know in a year you 'll forget i 'm gone 'cause i 'm not really something to be dwelled on that 's what they used to tell me all those kid at school so i 'm going by the law majority rule my presence on this earth is not needed any longer and if anything i hope this make you stronger you 're the best friend that i ever had such a shame i had to make you so very sad but just remember that you meant everything to me and to my heart you 're the only one that held the key now it 's time to go i 'm running out of space to write and yes i lost my fight but please just hold on tight i 'm watching over you from the cloud above and sending down the purest and whitest dove to watch over you and be my helpful eye so this is it world goodbye,1

this post probably wo n't make any sense but i have no one to talk to and just want to feel le alone i guess and feel like i have someone to talk to not everything is gon na be bad and not everything is gon na be good it 's just gon na come a it 's come i have been so overwhelmed lately for like no reason and really wan na cry but i can't i am starting to fall back into my obsession and idrk how to stop and if i want to stop i also watched the phantom of the opera movie from for the first time in a while and listen to the musical again and realized just how lonely the phantom felt and i kinda low-key relate also the whole music bit also get me cuz music is one way i can actually feel but that probably doe n't make sense lol i think i 'm starting to lose my vision also and my mom say it 's probably a side effect of my med but it 's kinda terrifying aha i will have to bring it up with my doc next time i see her my school drama club is finally getting to the point where we need sound and light in practice for this year 's play which mean i have something to do after school other than go home or to the one friend i have a house which is nice basketball season is almost over which mean no more pepband for the year so i 'm gon na be stuck at home even more until track season begin and i can do that i really hate this one kid who us my bari sax in the junior high cuz our school only ha and me and another girl use them in the h so he ha to use one of ours and of course it 's mine he always is breaking it he managed to literally break off a piece of it and it had to go to the shop for like week and i had to sit and do nothing and when we did get it back her messed up one of those wire thing that help the key move that are on the bar if you play a sax u probably know what i 'm talking about lucky our band director could fix it cuz he can fix minor damage to instrument but the jh kid also managed to mess up both the bottom pinky key and they keep getting stuck and it sound really airy i also think that the other bari will be going to a school connected to ours so she can still do 'extra stuff like band and sport but she wo n't be in class so i might end up the only bari in class but she will still be able to play for concert if she want she probably will cuz she love music too i feel really sad again and i do n't know why cuz like rn everything is going pretty good but i still feel bad anyway my dad want me to go to bed cuz it 's almost and i have school tomorrow so if you read this far thank you,1

i promised on another thread that i would tell my therapist today what 's actually on my mind so many hour later and i find myself in a psych ward before you think it 's all bad it is n't i 'll tell more down below first i talked my therapist after minute or so she switched gear and called the local hospital and their inhouse expertise i drove down to them and met up with two emergency pshyciactric personell that grilled me for minute about everything and a a result they wanted me to check in voluontarely to a psych ward which i agreed to they then gave me a oral temporary ban on driving they were kind enough to drive me up there in my own car though so i did n't have to pay for parking or anything then i had a similiar talk with the inhouse staff at the psych ward and here i sit in my own room at the psych ward writing this ca n't complain about the housing or staff they are very understanding and seem to enjoy working here phone and computer are allowed writing on my laptop i 've read a lot of stuff about this and wa kinda afraid of the whole deal but i could n't be more wrong from the impression i got so far i 'm only on my first day but i do n't think it 's so bad,1

i ca n't stand ctl right now i 'm training for crisis text line and i 'm hating some of their rule for helping texters they 're trying to make me talk like a robot instead of an actual person someone could relate to like you ca n't talk about yourself even if the texter asks which make no sense since we 're trying to make them feel le alone and you 're supposed to mirror back to them how they feel instead of parroting but it 's still pretty much just parroting in the example they give because they say how the texter feel right after they do which doe n't add anything and you have to give complement that are true but the example feel so ingenuine ex your willingness to reach out for help is truly inspiring i had to watch a video of an actual ctl conversation and if i wa that texter i would n't have felt uplifted at all but that texter did feel better at the end so maybe the people who use ctl are the easiest to help i do n't know ha anyone used ctl or anything like it and what do you like/not like about it because i want to get them to change their rule,1

after battling depression over the last year i have come to discover some tip that have improved the overall quality of my life the first and most important discovery wa a change in the way i perceived happiness before my bout with depression i assumed that happiness wa my natural state of mind and that being happy is just inherent happiness wa my baseline i didn t have to do anything and i just wa content of course this all changed once the darkness came creeping in and eventually my baseline emotional state wa grey here s what i discovered being happy take effort being happy is a skill and need to be worked on thinking that you can magically become happy or not depressed without changing any aspect of your life is absurd once i got my mind around this concept i worked on my emotional wellbeing every day it s a lot like weight lifting it take a lot of effort it isn t easy and it take a while before you see result however it is completely worth it in the end not everyone will derive joy from the same activity that are pleasant for me but i will share my experience in the hope that it help you out here are the simple thing i added to my life that helped lift the apathy sadness and empty dullness i wa stuck in talking about it i got in touch with a counselor and talked about it we literally just sat in a room and chatted back and forth about my feeling for an hour a week after a few week it really started to help i wa also fortunate to have a very loving and caring so that put up with me while i battled through the darker time putting away the booze i don t think i had a problem with booze but it wasn t improving the quality of my life so i stopped drinking made a difference exercising seriously it might sound clich√© but holy shit doe this ever help out lifting weight and doing hard cardio wa amazing for my mental health while you are busting your as in the gym or at home you leave your problem for a brief amount of time and focus on completing task at hand lift that fucking weight more time that s all i have to do just lift it the physical pain and concentration to just do simple body movement matched the pain i wa feeling inside and i wa finally able to match my mind and body being exhausted physically felt great and it released endorphin that gave me a much needed boost for hour after a workout it also helped with my energy level throughout the day i wa able to feel better and more energetic which translated into happiness over time walk around the block go for a run do a few pushup in your room just do it get out of breath push yourself for no reason feel your body get in the moment gardening i never planted shit before on a whim i bought some peat pellet some hot pepper seed and a few plastic container about a investment best money i ve ever spent the process of germinating seed watering plant taking care of them and seeing weekly progress is fantastic i read up on gardening visited some subreddits and picked up a new hobby i live in a tiny apartment in the middle of the city but i have a window with sunlight and that s all you need having nature around you will make you feel better get a plant grow something take care of it and it will take care of you try it out meditation i still suck at it but it work every morning before work i take minute for myself i just sit on the floor in my living room look out the window and breathe deep breath focusing on the act of breathing in out in out simple i added stretching into the mix stretch breathe minute not a lot of time not a lot of effort but the mental clarity achieved is great stop reading this right now take a deep breath a deep a you can and breathe it out do it again more time try it right now vitamin and water omega fish oil vitamin b multivitamin vitamin d. take them especially the omega and vitamin b. after only a couple day of supplementing my nutrition with extra vitamin i noticed a difference in my mood drink lot of water more than you are currently drinking now it s not hard go fill up a glass and drink some water plenty of article out there on the link between proper nutrition level hydration and mental health daily log and journal the world isn t out to get you people aren t out to get you your problem are not impossible to deal with but they do need to be addressed this wa hard for me to learn pick daily goal that s it what do you want to accomplish today what completed task would take a little weight off your shoulder need to make a phone call need to pay a bill need to wash your sheet once task one goal per day write it down that s important write down your goal and write down if you completed your goal at the end of the day you might not reach your goal every day but you need to try the feeling from accomplishing task is great even the small one just recognize what need to be done make a goal and try do it right now open up notepad or get a pen and paper and write down the date and what you d like to get done today big or small just try small improvement do something small that enhances your hygiene and/or appearance get a haircut trim/shave paint your nail shower wash your face cut your toenail brush your teeth whatever do something easy that make your appearance slightly better use some mouthwash make your breath smell a little better doesn t matter what you do just make a tiny adjustment a tiny improvement lot of tiny improvement over time make a big difference take care of your body and it will influence your mental state look better feel better be better small tiny incremental improvement you will get a boost from completing the task and overtime this add up understand that it is a journey it s hard for you and for me happiness is not baseline our normal everyday feeling are not happy that s ok. you can work towards a better life some of the shit that i mentioned above take minute the activity aren t hard most are enjoyable what s hard is bringing yourself to commit to them just fucking try it please pick a couple and try it out you re taking a small step to taking back being in charge of your mental wellbeing yeah you didn t choose to be depressed i know and probably feel like you have no control over your current state you can help turn the tide i went from daily suicidal thought to being able to crack a smile here and there you owe it to yourself to try i think you can do it you re awesome edit speaka_engrish brought up a great point just to tag on to number keep your room clean make your bed wash the dish do n't let little problem pile up take care of them sooner and eventually it becomes second nature a clean room is analogous to a clean mind edit andnowiknowwhy made another great suggestion find a creative thing you like and maybe are even good at making something can become very meditative and self-asserting whether it 's drawing or doing something with fabric wood clay metal styropor papermach√© thread or whatnot it is an alternative form of meditation for people who are not into more common form of it just do n't do it to create something perfect but rather to just create for the fun of it it can be very stimulating and i like to create useful stuff for my household just googling the word easy diy and hit the image search will provide you with ton of idea of which might be for you also r/crafts r/diy and all the other sub linked there might be an inspiration to find the right choice of material for you,1

anybody else just over it all i am and have been fighting off suicidal ideation for the better part of year i even started seeing a therapist and i swear she 's only made thing worse she refuse to give me any antidepressant or help for my crippling anxiety or ptsd she is condescending and seriously pulled up google last week during our appt to tell me how to best help my fibromyalgia and anxiety i almost walked out right then so on that end yes she 's gone finding a new therapist who doe n't suck but between the chronic fatigue and pain and the financial difficulty we are facing i just feel like year wa good enough and i would have no qualm with saying goodbye main reason i continue to stick it out is my two adult son and my husband of year i know when i 've told my spouse about my depression he just say he 'll hate me if i commit suicide it 's rather funny in a black humor sort of way a i 'll be dead so why will that really matter truth is i have a life insurance policy that is n't much but would at least give my husband and boy some money to start a new life i am sure to pay it every month and have had the policy for over year so well past any suicide clause because of my copd depression fibromyalgia and other health problem i can not up the policy or start a new one a i am always denied i do work hour a week and while i like my job i have year until i can retire with a pension more year of this life is unbearable and there is no way i will hold on that long i am a victim service officer and the coordinator for the entire county i live in the work should be something that stop me from feeling suicidal i.know but it doe n't in fact often time helping victim of sexual assault and extreme violence just trigger my own ptsd i have been reading through some of the post i see here and while i think many of you are amazingly kind for your word of hope and your willingness to reach out to help that is not really what i am looking for i just want to know what some other coping skill maybe some of you have tried i feel like i have tried everything and have run out of option for continuing to keep up this facade of loving life i do n't love life and every morning that i wake up i wish more than anything that i hadnt the depression is just too much to bear and no doctor are even willing to try any antidepressant or anti anxiety medication for me even my quack therapist tell me i 'm just negative and do n't need medication she doe n't have any idea how close to commiting suicide i am and she would just tell me suicide wo n't solve anything however a anyone of you who ha ever felt suicidal know that is not true and often time when one is suicidal they have a damn good reason to be and their thought are extremely valid and deserve to be heard and respected so any option for trying to u in a better outlook on life is welcome but please i am not here for sympathy or anything like that i just want to feel certain that i really have given life a fair chance before i end my own also i am not religious in fact i hate god and could list a million reason why and with all due respect i want to hear nothing about god thanks in advance for your thought and know i do n't sit online so may not respond for a while and do.t want anyone freaking out or thinking i am being rude by not responding right away,1

i actually think about this fairly often because it 's something that carry over into living in sharehouses when you 're one of many sibling you do n't expect to be able to take up all the space like i moved in with someone who thought it wa fine to spend all her time in the main living area watching what she wanted to watch on the tv cooking weird smelly thing and decorating how she wanted without any regard to oh no-but-wtf owns thing too that might need to go in this room it would never occur to me to do that if you 're sharing a living space with someone you can do that stuff half the time but there 's this innate understanding that some night you got ta leave the main space for the other person and some night you got ta let them have first go in the kitchen and when you first move in you ask so what bookshelves/etc do you have that we need to fit in here i often think i m not assertive enough about taking up space honestly i 'm pretty chill about this kind of thing because i grew up sharing everything all the time so only sharing with one person wa nice although i moved in on my own eventually and god it 's glorious to be able to put a book down on the table and know it 'll still be in exactly the same place tomorrow,0

i really hate when people honk for minor or no reason remember that time you had to stop at a red light and after it turned green again it took you one second to actually process it and start driving again too late you got that loud honk from the car behind you making you feel like a total human garbage or when you sprinted across the road when the car wa minute away and they still honk to show you that they are much more clever than you are and that you should n't ever cross the road in front of them again everytime someone honk for no reason or a minor reason often cause by their little to no patience i want to turn into every gta character ever and throw them out of the car onto the road i do n't know if it happens so much in my country only or if this is a worldwide thing actually i 've traveled quite a lot and i have n't see it so much elsewhere so i 'm really curious if you guy hate this too or even if you are that person no worry i wo n't judge you i feel like my friend do not get angry about this and they even honk at every opportunity they 're given so i want to know if i 'm weird or this is a common thing,0

i feel so differently this time thought hey ya 'll like so many of the people in this community i 'm not a stranger to embracing the idea of nonexistence but every time i 've felt like now wa the right time to end my life it 's been a driven passionate experience a kind of push to escape the pain of what i wa feeling again just like everybody else during some of the darkest part of my depression i found myself convinced that the pain wa never going to stop that the only way it would ever be any better wa if i took matter into my own hand and stopped feeling anything at all suicide wa the ultimate painkiller something i carried in my bag next to the ibuprofen something i could use to cure lifelong agony rather than just headache but these past few week have been a very different affair i 've come to feel that there is something that set me apart from other people namely that there is a lack of vibrancy of color of depth in my life i see a passion of experience in other people that i have n't been able to feel for a very long time this realization ha encouraged me to get my affair in order but i find myself at a crossroad a i care so much more about handling thing responsibly now i 've had the time to really examine how i want my life to be handled when i 'm not around to life it a with any suicide there come a point when i have to make a choice i ca n't take back quitting my job leaving the key to my apartment with the landlord thing that would put me on the street if i did n't follow through so in a much smaller way than pulling the trigger all the pressure of following through with my choice rest on something much le significant than taking the final step over the edge or kicking the chair out from under me i 'm struggling with feeling completely at ease with making those choice though i 'm not sure anyone ever really doe so like the title say thought,1
